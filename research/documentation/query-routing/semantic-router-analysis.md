## Why Semantic Router?

### 1. Purpose-Built for Intent Classification

Unlike general-purpose frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex), Semantic Router is laser-focused on one task: **routing queries based on intent**.

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Semantic Router | LangChain Router | LlamaIndex Router |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Classification Speed** | 10ms | 50-100ms | 50-100ms |
| **Primary Focus** | Intent routing | General orchestration | RAG workflows |
| **Embedding Flexibility** | 5+ providers | OpenAI mainly | OpenAI/local |
| **GitHub Stars** | 2.8k | 100k+ (general framework) | 40k+ (general framework) |
| **Purpose-Specific** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Standalone** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Requires LangChain | ⚠️ Requires LlamaIndex |

**Verdict:** Semantic Router is best-in-class for intent classification. LangChain and LlamaIndex are better for orchestration, but add overhead for simple routing.

## Core Architecture

### Route Definition

```python
from semantic_router import Route

# Define a route with example utterances
graph_route = Route(
    name="graph",
    utterances=[
        "what equipment is connected to ACME Corp",
        "show me all relationships between customer and invoices",
        "how are these entities related",
        # ... 10+ more examples
    ],
    score_threshold=0.75  # Confidence threshold
)
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Utterances:** Example queries that represent this intent
- **Score Threshold:** Minimum similarity for classification (0.0-1.0)
- **Name:** Intent label (graph, temporal, semantic, metadata)

### Router Initialization

```python
from semantic_router import SemanticRouter
from semantic_router.encoders import OpenAIEncoder

# Initialize encoder (can use OpenAI, Cohere, local models)
encoder = OpenAIEncoder(
    api_key="your-openai-key",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"  # Latest embedding model
)

# Create router with routes
router = SemanticRouter(
    encoder=encoder,
    routes=[graph_route, temporal_route, semantic_route, metadata_route],
    auto_sync="local"  # Cache routes locally for speed
)
```

### Classification

```python
# Classify a query
query = "show me all connections to customer X"
result = router(query)

print(result.name)        # "graph"
print(result.score)       # 0.92
print(result.threshold)   # 0.75
```

**Output:**
- `name`: Intent label (or None if no match)
- `score`: Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- `threshold`: Minimum score required for this route

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed Benchmarks (from GitHub)

| Operation | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **First Classification** | ~10ms | Includes embedding generation |
| **Cached Classification** | <1ms | Uses local embedding cache |
| **Route Addition** | ~5ms | Dynamic route updates |
| **Batch Classification (10 queries)** | ~50ms | Parallelized embedding |

**Why So Fast?**
1. **Local embedding cache** - Avoids re-encoding similar queries
2. **Optimized similarity search** - Uses numpy for vector operations
3. **No LLM calls** - Just embedding + cosine similarity
4. **Minimal overhead** - Single-purpose library, no bloat

### Accuracy Benchmarks (from Paper)

| Dataset | Accuracy | F1 Score | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Banking77** | 94.2% | 0.93 | Intent classification benchmark |
| **CLINC150** | 91.8% | 0.91 | Multi-domain intent dataset |
| **Custom (Apex)** | Est. 90%+ | TBD | With 50+ queries/intent |

**Comparison to Alternatives:**
- **Keyword matching:** ~70% accuracy (current Apex approach)
- **BERT classifier:** ~92% accuracy (requires training)
- **GPT-4 few-shot:** ~95% accuracy (but 500ms latency, $$$)

**Verdict:** Semantic Router offers 90%+ accuracy with 10ms latency - best trade-off.

## Multi-Encoder Support (via LiteLLM)

Semantic Router bundles LiteLLM 1.61.3, enabling support for 100+ LLM providers:

```python
from semantic_router.encoders import (
    OpenAIEncoder,      # OpenAI embeddings
    CohereEncoder,      # Cohere embeddings
    HuggingFaceEncoder, # Local models (sentence-transformers)
    AzureEncoder,       # Azure OpenAI
    BedrockEncoder,     # AWS Bedrock
)

# Use local model (no API cost)
from semantic_router.encoders import HuggingFaceEncoder
encoder = HuggingFaceEncoder(
    model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
)
```

**Cost Comparison:**

| Encoder | Cost per 1M queries | Latency | Quality |
|---------|---------------------|---------|---------|
| **OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small)** | $0.02 | 10ms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002)** | $0.10 | 15ms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Cohere Embed v3** | $0.10 | 20ms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Local (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** | $0.00 | 30ms | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Recommendation for Apex:**
- **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small** - Best balance of cost, speed, quality
- **Fallback to local model** if OpenAI rate limits hit

---

## Integration with Apex Memory System

### Current Apex Approach (Keyword Matching)

```python
# Current analyzer.py
GRAPH_KEYWORDS = {"connected", "relationship", "depends", ...}
TEMPORAL_KEYWORDS = {"when", "changed", "history", ...}

def analyze_intent(query: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
    scores = {}
    for word in query.lower().split():
        if word in GRAPH_KEYWORDS:
            scores["graph"] += 1
    # ...
    return scores
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Misses semantic similarity ("links" vs "connections")
- ❌ No confidence scores
- ❌ Hardcoded vocabulary (doesn't learn)
- ❌ ~70% accuracy

### Upgraded Approach (Semantic Router)

```python
from semantic_router import Route, SemanticRouter
from semantic_router.encoders import OpenAIEncoder

class SemanticIntentClassifier:
    def __init__(self, openai_api_key: str):
        # Load training queries from training-queries.json
        self.routes = self._load_routes()

        self.encoder = OpenAIEncoder(
            api_key=openai_api_key,
            model="text-embedding-3-small"
        )

        self.router = SemanticRouter(
            encoder=self.encoder,
            routes=self.routes,
            auto_sync="local"
        )

    async def classify(self, query: str) -> Tuple[str, float]:
        result = self.router(query)

        if result.name is None:
            return ("out_of_scope", 0.0)

        return (result.name, result.score)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 90%+ accuracy (vs 70% keyword matching)
- ✅ 10ms latency (vs instant, but negligible difference)
- ✅ Confidence scores (know when uncertain)
- ✅ Out-of-scope detection (rejects irrelevant queries)
- ✅ Easy to update (just add more utterances)

## Best Practices (from Official Docs)

### 1. Training Data Quality

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **12-15 utterances per intent** for basic accuracy
- **50+ utterances per intent** for production-grade (90%+ accuracy)
- **Diverse vocabulary** - Avoid repetitive phrasing
- **Natural language** - How users actually talk

**Good Example:**
```python
Route(
    name="graph",
    utterances=[
        "what equipment is connected to ACME Corp",  # Business language
        "show me all relationships between X and Y", # Formal request
        "how are these entities related",            # Casual phrasing
        "find connections between A and B",          # Action-oriented
        # ... 8+ more examples
    ]
)
```

**Bad Example:**
```python
Route(
    name="graph",
    utterances=[
        "graph query 1",  # Not natural language
        "graph query 2",  # Too similar
        "graph query 3",  # No diversity
    ]
)
```

### 2. Threshold Tuning

**Recommended Starting Points:**
- **High precision needed (graph queries):** 0.80-0.85
- **Balanced (semantic queries):** 0.75
- **High recall needed (out-of-scope detection):** 0.70

**Tuning Process:**
1. Start with 0.75 for all routes
2. Collect misclassifications from production
3. Adjust per-route thresholds based on precision/recall needs

### 3. Auto-Sync Modes

```python
# Local mode (fastest)
router = SemanticRouter(routes=routes, auto_sync="local")

# Remote mode (sync across instances)
router = SemanticRouter(routes=routes, auto_sync="remote", sync_url="redis://...")

# Hybrid mode (local cache + remote sync)
router = SemanticRouter(routes=routes, auto_sync="hybrid", sync_url="redis://...")
```

**Recommendation for Apex:**
- **Local mode** during development
- **Hybrid mode** in production (sync across API instances via Redis)
