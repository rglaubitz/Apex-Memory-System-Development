**Latest Release:** v0.20.3 (September 8, 2025)

#### Overview

Graphiti is a Python framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically designed for AI agents operating in dynamic environments. It provides autonomous knowledge graph construction while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context.

#### Key Statistics

- **Contributors:** 35+
- **Forks:** ~1,700
- **Weekly PyPI Downloads:** 25,000+
- **Growth:** 14,000 stars in first 8 months (launched early 2024)
- **Activity:** Very active - regular releases, commits, and community engagement

#### Temporal Intelligence Features

**Bi-Temporal Data Model:**
- **Transaction Time (Database Timeline):**
  - `created_at`: When a relation was added to the database (always present)
  - `expired_at`: When a relation was invalidated at database level (set on conflict)

- **Valid Time (Real-World Timeline):**
  - `valid_at`: When a fact/relationship became true in reality (optional, LLM-extracted)
  - `invalid_at`: When a fact/relationship ceased being true (optional, LLM-extracted)

**Temporal Reasoning Capabilities:**
- Point-in-time queries: Reconstruct knowledge state at any historical moment
- Temporal conflict resolution: Intelligent handling of contradicting information
- Non-chronological ingestion: Add episodes out of order with correct temporal alignment
- Pattern detection: Analyze how relationships evolve over time
- Time-travel queries: Compare database state at different transaction times

#### Architecture

**Storage Backend Options:**
- Neo4j 5.26+ (primary)
- FalkorDB 1.1.2+
- Kuzu 0.11.2+
- Amazon Neptune

**Core Components:**
- LLM-based entity extraction with temporal metadata
- Hybrid retrieval: Semantic embeddings + BM25 keyword search + graph traversal
- Temporal conflict detection and resolution engine
- Bi-temporal indexing for efficient historical queries

#### Code Example: Adding Episodes with Temporal Context

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from graphiti_core.nodes import EpisodeType

# Initialize Graphiti client
graphiti = Graphiti("neo4j://localhost:7687", "neo4j", "password")

# Add episode with reference time for temporal context
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="Episode_2024_Q1_Report",
    episode_body="""
    John Smith was promoted to VP of Engineering on January 15, 2024.
    He previously served as Director of Engineering since 2022.
    The promotion was effective immediately.
    """,
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    source_description="HR records",
    reference_time=datetime(2024, 1, 15, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
)

# Query with temporal awareness
results = await graphiti.search(
    query="What was John Smith's role in January 2024?",
    # Temporal filtering capabilities (planned feature)
)
```

#### Code Example: Bi-Temporal Edge Structure

```cypher
// Graphiti edge structure in Neo4j
CREATE (e:Entity {name: "John Smith"})
CREATE (r:Entity {name: "VP of Engineering"})
CREATE (e)-[rel:HAS_ROLE {
    // Transaction time (database timeline)
    created_at: datetime("2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"),
    expired_at: null,  // Still current in database

    // Valid time (real-world timeline)
    valid_at: datetime("2024-01-15T00:00:00Z"),
    invalid_at: null,  // Still valid in reality

    // Additional metadata
    fact: "John Smith holds position of VP of Engineering",
    source: "HR records"
}]->(r)
```

#### Temporal Query Patterns

**Pattern 1: Point-in-Time Reconstruction**
```python
# Reconstruct knowledge state as it was known on a specific date
results = await graphiti.search(
    query="What positions did executives hold?",
    # Filter by transaction_time to see database state as-of specific date
    # Filter by valid_time to see real-world state as-of specific date
)
```

**Pattern 2: Temporal Conflict Resolution**
```python
# When new information conflicts with existing edges
# Graphiti automatically:
# 1. Sets expired_at on old edge (transaction time)
# 2. Sets invalid_at on old edge (valid time)
# 3. Creates new edge with current information
# 4. Preserves historical record for time-travel queries
```

**Pattern 3: Relationship Evolution Tracking**
```python
# Track how relationships change over time
# Example: Job history, organizational changes, project assignments
# All historical states preserved with precise temporal boundaries
```

#### Integration Points for Apex Memory System

**Direct Alignment:**
1. **Bi-temporal model** matches our valid time + transaction time requirements
2. **Neo4j backend** aligns with our existing graph database choice
3. **Python SDK** integrates seamlessly with our FastAPI architecture
4. **LLM-based extraction** can leverage our existing OpenAI integration

**Potential Adaptations:**
1. Use Graphiti as temporal layer on top of our multi-database architecture
2. Extract temporal reasoning patterns for custom implementation
3. Leverage hybrid retrieval strategy (semantic + keyword + graph)
4. Adopt temporal conflict resolution algorithms

#### Production Readiness

**Strengths:**
- Battle-tested in production (25k weekly downloads)
- Active development and community support
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Apache 2.0 license (permissive)

**Considerations:**
- Relatively new project (launched 2024)
- API still evolving (v0.20.x indicates pre-1.0)
- Temporal filtering API still in development
- Requires careful evaluation for enterprise scale

#### Code Example: Bitemporal SQL Queries (XTDB 2.x)

```sql
-- Query data as it exists now (both valid time and system time = current)
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Time-travel: Query valid-time in the past with current system-time
-- "What did we think the engineering team looked like on Jan 1, 2024?"
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-01'
WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Audit query: Compare past system-time with current knowledge
-- "What did we know about the engineering team on Jan 1 vs. now?"
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Full bi-temporal query: Both time dimensions in the past
-- "What did we know on March 1 about employees as-of Jan 1?"
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-01-01'
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-03-01 00:00:00'
WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Temporal range query: All states during a period
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR VALID_TIME FROM DATE '2024-01-01' TO DATE '2024-12-31'
WHERE employee_id = 'E123';
```

#### Code Example: Datalog Queries (XTDB 1.x)

```clojure
;; Query with valid-time and transaction-time
(xt/q (xt/db node
              {:valid-time #inst "2024-01-01"
               :tx-time #inst "2024-03-01"})
      '{:find [?name ?dept]
        :where [[?e :employee/name ?name]
                [?e :employee/department ?dept]
                [?e :employee/active true]]})

;; Temporal range query
(xt/entity-history
  (xt/db node)
  :employee/E123
  :asc
  {:with-docs? true})
```

#### Temporal Query Patterns

**Pattern 1: Compliance Reporting**
```sql
-- Generate report showing all changes to employee records in 2024
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    VALID_TIME_START,
    VALID_TIME_END,
    SYSTEM_TIME_START
FROM employees
FOR VALID_TIME FROM '2024-01-01' TO '2024-12-31'
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
```

**Pattern 2: Retroactive Corrections**
```sql
-- Correct past data without losing audit trail
-- Insert record with valid time in the past
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, salary)
FOR VALID_TIME FROM '2024-01-01'
VALUES ('E123', 95000);
-- System time = now, but valid time = historical
-- Original record preserved with updated valid_time_end
```

**Pattern 3: Temporal Join**
```sql
-- Join tables at consistent point in time
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees FOR VALID_TIME AS OF '2024-01-01' e
JOIN departments FOR VALID_TIME AS OF '2024-01-01' d
  ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

#### Integration Points for Apex Memory System

**Conceptual Alignment:**
1. **Bitemporal model** provides reference implementation for temporal design
2. **SQL:2011 compliance** offers standardized temporal query syntax
3. **Immutable architecture** ensures complete audit trail
4. **Time-travel queries** demonstrate advanced temporal reasoning

**Practical Considerations:**
- **Language:** Clojure may not integrate well with our Python stack
- **Database:** Requires dedicated XTDB database vs. our multi-database approach
- **Adoption:** Pattern extraction more valuable than direct integration

**Value for Research:**
- Reference implementation of bi-temporal SQL standard
- Query pattern examples for temporal operations
- Architecture patterns for immutable temporal storage
- Validation that bi-temporal approach is production-proven

## Temporal Intelligence Patterns

### Pattern 1: Bi-Temporal Data Modeling

**Core Concept:** Separate two independent time dimensions for complete temporal tracking.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Transaction Time (Database Timeline)
created_at: datetime  # When fact entered database
expired_at: datetime | None  # When fact invalidated in database

# Valid Time (Real-World Timeline)
valid_at: datetime | None  # When fact became true
invalid_at: datetime | None  # When fact ceased being true
```

**Use Cases:**
- Regulatory compliance and audit trails
- Historical analysis and reporting
- Error correction without data loss
- Temporal conflict resolution

**Apex Integration:**
- Apply to all entities and relationships in Neo4j
- Store temporal metadata in PostgreSQL for hybrid queries
- Use Redis to cache temporal query results
- Leverage Graphiti integration for time-aware entity tracking

---

### Pattern 2: Temporal Conflict Resolution

**Core Concept:** Intelligently handle contradicting information by preserving all versions with temporal boundaries.

**Graphiti Approach:**
```python
# When new episode conflicts with existing knowledge
# 1. Semantic + keyword + graph search detects conflict
# 2. Set expired_at on old edge (transaction timeline)
# 3. Set invalid_at on old edge (valid timeline)
# 4. Create new edge with updated information
# 5. Both edges preserved for historical queries
```

**Use Cases:**
- Handling real-time updates to knowledge base
- Correcting errors while maintaining audit trail
- Tracking evolving relationships (job changes, org restructures)
- Managing conflicting information sources

**Apex Integration:**
- Implement conflict detection in ingestion pipeline
- Use temporal metadata to resolve conflicts automatically
- Preserve all versions for temporal queries
- Enable users to query "what did we know when?"

---

### Pattern 3: Point-in-Time Reconstruction

**Core Concept:** Reconstruct complete knowledge state as it existed at any historical moment.

**XTDB SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Reconstruct entire database state as-of specific date
SELECT * FROM all_tables
FOR VALID_TIME AS OF '2024-01-01'
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-01-01';
```

**Graphiti Pattern:**
```python
# Query with temporal filtering
results = await graphiti.search(
    query="What was the organizational structure?",
    # Filter edges by created_at, expired_at, valid_at, invalid_at
    # Reconstruct graph state at specific point in time
)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Compliance reporting at specific dates
- Historical analysis and trend detection
- Debugging data issues by time-traveling
- Comparing knowledge evolution over time

**Apex Integration:**
- Add temporal filtering to query router
- Enable time-travel queries across all databases
- Cache point-in-time snapshots in Redis
- Visualize temporal evolution in UI

---

### Pattern 4: Time-Aware Entity Tracking

**Core Concept:** Track entities and relationships with precise temporal lifecycles.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Entity with temporal lifecycle
entity = {
    "id": "john_smith_001",
    "type": "Person",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "created_at": "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",  # First appearance in system
    "properties": [
        {
            "key": "title",
            "value": "Software Engineer",
            "valid_from": "2020-01-01",
            "valid_to": "2022-06-30",
            "recorded_at": "2020-01-05"
        },
        {
            "key": "title",
            "value": "Senior Engineer",
            "valid_from": "2022-07-01",
            "valid_to": "2024-01-14",
            "recorded_at": "2022-06-15"
        },
        {
            "key": "title",
            "value": "VP Engineering",
            "valid_from": "2024-01-15",
            "valid_to": None,  # Current
            "recorded_at": "2024-01-15"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Career progression tracking
- Organizational hierarchy evolution
- Project assignment history
- Document version control

**Apex Integration:**
- Extend entity schema with temporal fields
- Track property changes with full history
- Enable queries like "who reported to X on date Y?"
- Support temporal aggregations and analytics

---

### Pattern 5: Retroactive Data Correction

**Core Concept:** Correct historical errors while maintaining complete audit trail.

**XTDB Approach:**
```sql
-- Correct past salary error discovered today
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, salary)
FOR VALID_TIME FROM '2024-01-01'
VALUES ('E123', 95000);

-- Result:
-- Old record: valid 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-06, system_time 2024-01-01
-- New record: valid 2024-01-01 to forever, system_time 2025-10-06 (today)
-- Complete audit trail preserved
```

**Graphiti Pattern:**
```python
# Add episode with past reference_time to correct historical error
await graphiti.add_episode(
    name="Salary_Correction_2024",
    episode_body="John's actual 2024 salary was $95k, not $90k",
    reference_time=datetime(2024, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    # Creates new edge with valid_at in past
    # Old edge gets invalid_at set appropriately
)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Correcting data entry errors
- Backdating discovered information
- Regulatory compliance updates
- Historical record amendments

**Apex Integration:**
- Support retroactive writes in ingestion pipeline
- Maintain audit log of all corrections
- Enable compliance reporting with correction tracking
- Visualize correction impact on historical queries

## Cross-Reference: Graphiti Integration

### Existing Graphiti Documentation

The Apex Memory System already has Graphiti documentation in the research directory. This temporal intelligence research complements and extends that work:

**Location:** `research/documentation/graphiti/`

**Integration Points:**
1. **Bi-temporal model** documented here provides implementation details for temporal layer
2. **Code examples** demonstrate practical usage of Graphiti's temporal features
3. **Query patterns** show how to leverage temporal metadata in searches
4. **Architecture insights** inform our Graphiti integration strategy

**Recommendation:** Cross-reference this temporal patterns research when implementing Graphiti integration. The bi-temporal concepts documented here are foundational to Graphiti's design.

## Key Temporal Concepts for Apex Memory System

### 1. Valid Time vs. Transaction Time

**Valid Time (Real-World Timeline):**
- When a fact is/was/will be true in reality
- Business-domain concept
- Can be set retroactively
- Supports future-dated facts
- Example: "Employee salary effective January 1, 2024"

**Transaction Time (Database Timeline):**
- When a fact was recorded in the database
- System-managed, immutable
- Always increases monotonically
- Supports audit and compliance
- Example: "Salary record inserted on January 5, 2024"

**Why Both Matter:**
- Valid time answers: "What was true when?"
- Transaction time answers: "What did we know when?"
- Together they enable: "What did we know on date X about reality on date Y?"

### 2. Temporal Queries

**Point-in-Time Query:**
```python
# Query knowledge state as-of specific date
query_date = datetime(2024, 6, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
results = search_with_temporal_filter(
    valid_time_lte=query_date,
    transaction_time_lte=query_date
)
```

**Temporal Range Query:**
```python
# All changes during a period
results = search_with_temporal_range(
    valid_time_start=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    valid_time_end=datetime(2024, 12, 31)
)
```

**Temporal Join:**
```cypher
// Neo4j: Join entities at consistent point in time
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company)
WHERE r.valid_at <= datetime('2024-01-01')
  AND (r.invalid_at IS NULL OR r.invalid_at > datetime('2024-01-01'))
RETURN p.name, c.name
```

### 3. Temporal Conflict Resolution

**Conflict Types:**
1. **Direct contradiction:** "John is VP" vs "John is Director" (same time)
2. **Temporal overlap:** Role A from 2022-2024, Role B from 2023-2025
3. **Late-arriving data:** Learning about past event after it occurred

**Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Last-write-wins:** Most recent transaction time prevails
2. **Valid-time precedence:** Most recent valid time prevails
3. **Semantic resolution:** LLM determines which fact is correct
4. **Preserve all:** Keep all versions with temporal boundaries

**Graphiti's Approach:**
- Semantic similarity search detects conflicts
- LLM evaluates which version is correct
- Temporal metadata preserves all versions
- Expired/invalid flags mark superseded data

### 4. Temporal Indexing

**Requirements:**
- Fast point-in-time queries
- Efficient range scans
- Support for both time dimensions
- Handle sparse temporal data

**Strategies:**
1. **Interval tree:** For overlapping temporal ranges
2. **Bitemporal index:** Composite index on (valid_time, transaction_time)
3. **Timeline projection:** Separate indexes for each timeline
4. **Materialized snapshots:** Pre-computed states at key dates

**Apex Implementation:**
- Neo4j: Temporal indexes on relationship properties
- PostgreSQL: B-tree indexes on temporal columns
- Qdrant: Temporal filtering in vector search
- Redis: Cache temporal query results
