## Key Findings Summary

### Repositories Identified

**1. Graphiti (getzep/graphiti)**
- **Stars:** 18,600+ ⭐ (12x above threshold)
- **Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (last commit: Sep 29, 2025)
- **License:** ✅ Apache 2.0
- **Language:** Python
- **Fit:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect for Apex (Python + Neo4j)
- **Recommendation:** ADOPT for temporal layer

**2. XTDB (xtdb/xtdb)**
- **Stars:** 2,600+ ⭐ (1.7x above threshold)
- **Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (last commit: Oct 1, 2025)
- **License:** ✅ MIT
- **Language:** Clojure
- **Fit:** ⭐⭐⭐ Reference implementation
- **Recommendation:** REFERENCE for patterns

### Core Pattern: Bi-Temporal Model

Both repositories implement the same foundational pattern:

**Transaction Time (Database Timeline):**
- `created_at`: When fact entered database
- `expired_at`: When fact was invalidated

**Valid Time (Real-World Timeline):**
- `valid_at`: When fact became true
- `invalid_at`: When fact ceased being true

This enables:
- Time-travel queries
- Retroactive corrections
- Conflict resolution
- Complete audit trails
- Compliance reporting

### Integration Recommendation

**Adopt Graphiti as temporal layer:**
- Proven community adoption (18.6k stars, 25k weekly downloads)
- Perfect technology alignment (Python + Neo4j)
- Active development (v0.20.x, regular releases)
- Comprehensive bi-temporal implementation
- LLM-based entity extraction included

**Reference XTDB for patterns:**
- Production-proven bi-temporal SQL (v2.0 GA)
- SQL:2011 compliance
- Query pattern reference
- Temporal indexing strategies
