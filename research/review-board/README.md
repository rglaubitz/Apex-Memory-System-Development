# Review Board

C-suite executive validation reviews for execution plans during **Phase 3.5** of the phased development workflow.

## Purpose

The Review Board is a quality gate that validates execution plans before implementation begins. It ensures:

1. **Research Quality** - CIO validates research follows source hierarchy
2. **Technical Soundness** - CTO validates architecture and implementation feasibility
3. **Operational Feasibility** - COO validates execution capacity and timeline realism

**All 3 executives must approve** before Phase 4 (Implementation) can begin.

## Process

```
Execution Plan Ready (Phase 3 Complete)
         ↓
   Review Board (Phase 3.5)
         ↓
   ┌─────┴─────┐
   ↓           ↓           ↓
  CIO         CTO         COO
Research  Technology  Operations
         ↓
   All Approve?
         ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
   Yes       No
    ↓         ↓
 Phase 4   Revise Plan
Implementation
```

## Review Order

1. **CIO** reviews first - Research foundation must be solid
2. **CTO** reviews second - Technical architecture must be sound
3. **COO** reviews last - Operational execution must be realistic

**Rationale:** If research is weak, no point reviewing technical architecture. If architecture is flawed, no point reviewing operations.

## Verdicts

Each executive provides one of three verdicts:

### ✅ APPROVED
- Score: 70-100
- Plan meets all quality standards
- Proceed to Phase 4 (Implementation)

### ⚠️ APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS
- Score: 60-69
- Plan is acceptable but has noted concerns
- Concerns must be addressed during implementation
- Proceed to Phase 4 with caution

### ❌ REJECTED
- Score: 0-59
- Plan has major issues
- Must revise and resubmit
- Cannot proceed to Phase 4

**Veto Power:** Any REJECTED verdict blocks implementation, regardless of other approvals.

   - Overall score (0-100)
   - Key findings

2. **Detailed Rubric**

## Example Review

**File:** [cio-review.md](cio-review.md)

This is an example CIO review of an execution plan, showing the full review format and scoring rubric.

## Resubmission Process

If any executive REJECTS the plan:

1. **Address Blockers** - Fix all critical issues identified
2. **Revise Plan** - Update execution plan with fixes
3. **Resubmit** - Request new Review Board validation
4. **Re-Review** - Same process, all 3 executives re-review

**No Partial Approvals:** All 3 must approve the final version.

## Review Timeline

Typical Review Board timeline:

- **Day 1:** CIO reviews research quality
- **Day 2:** CTO reviews technical architecture
