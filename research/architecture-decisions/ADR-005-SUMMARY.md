# ADR-005 Executive Summary: HNSW vs IVFFlat Vector Indexing

## Decision at a Glance

**Selected:** HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for both PostgreSQL pgvector and Qdrant

**Why:** 15.5x faster queries with superior recall accuracy justifies the trade-off of slower index builds

**Impact:** Directly supports <1s P90 latency target and >90% recall accuracy requirements

---

## Key Performance Metrics

### The Winning Numbers (1M Vectors Benchmark)

| Metric | IVFFlat | HNSW | Winner |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| **Query Speed** | 2.6 QPS | 40.5 QPS | HNSW 15.5x faster |
| **Recall Accuracy** | ~92% | ~97% | HNSW +5% better |
| **Build Time** | 2 min | 68 min | IVFFlat 31.8x faster |
| **Index Size** | 257 MB | 729 MB | IVFFlat 2.8x smaller |

### The Trade-off We're Making

**We're choosing:**
- 15.5x faster queries (every user interaction)
- 5% better recall accuracy (better results quality)

**In exchange for:**
- 31.8x slower index builds (one-time operation)
- 2.8x more memory (manageable with planning)

## Why HNSW Wins for Apex Memory System

### 1. Query Performance is Critical
- Users interact with queries constantly
- Index builds happen once or incrementally
- Priority: Fast user experience > fast deployment

### 2. Logarithmic Scaling
- IVFFlat: Linear search time as data grows
- HNSW: Logarithmic scaling handles millions of vectors
- Future-proof for corpus expansion

### 3. Dynamic Data Support
- No training phase required
- Incremental updates without full rebuild
- Supports continuous document ingestion (10+ docs/sec target)

### 4. Industry Standard
- Used by Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus
- Extensive production validation
- Lower operational risk

## Production Configuration

### PostgreSQL pgvector

```sql
-- Optimized for OpenAI embeddings (1536 dimensions)
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 24, ef_construction = 100);

-- Query tuning (adjustable per query)
SET hnsw.ef_search = 40;  -- Balanced (default)
-- SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;  -- High accuracy
-- SET hnsw.ef_search = 20;   -- High speed
```

### Qdrant

```python
# Collection creation
hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(
    m=24,              # Higher for high-dimensional data
    ef_construct=200   # Double default for quality
)

# Search tuning
search_params=models.SearchParams(
    hnsw_ef=64   # Fast, balanced, or accurate (20/64/128)
)
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Slower Build Times
- **Solution:** Build indexes concurrently (no blocking)
- **Solution:** Incremental updates as documents ingested
- **Solution:** Background processing during off-peak hours

### Higher Memory Consumption
- **Solution:** Provision 4-8GB RAM minimum for databases
- **Solution:** Monitor memory usage with alerts
- **Solution:** Use Qdrant on-disk mode if critical (performance trade-off)

### Complex Parameter Tuning
- **Solution:** Start with documented defaults (m=24, ef_construction=100)
- **Solution:** Adjust ef_search first (no rebuild required)
- **Solution:** Automated benchmark scripts for testing

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1:** Configure pgvector and Qdrant with HNSW parameters
- **Week 2:** Benchmark and validate performance targets
- **Week 2-3:** Document operations and monitoring procedures
- **Ongoing:** Monitor metrics and tune parameters

## Next Steps

1. **Submit to Review Board** - CIO, CTO, COO approval required
2. **Upon Approval:** Execute Phase 4 implementation plan
3. **Validate:** Ensure P90 < 1s latency and >90% recall
4. **Monitor:** Track query performance, memory usage, index builds

## Questions for Review Board

### For CIO (Research Quality)
- Are the 10+ sources sufficient and credible?
- Is the source hierarchy properly validated (Tier 1-3)?
- Are benchmarks current and applicable to our use case?

### For CTO (Technical Architecture)
- Does HNSW configuration align with system architecture?
- Are memory requirements manageable within infrastructure?
- Is parameter tuning strategy sound?

### For COO (Operational Capacity)
- Can team execute implementation in 3-week timeline?
- Are mitigation strategies realistic and achievable?
- Is monitoring and alerting plan adequate?
