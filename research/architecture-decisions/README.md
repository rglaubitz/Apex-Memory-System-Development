# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document architectural decisions with research citations.

## Purpose

ADRs provide a record of significant architectural choices made during the project, including the context, options considered, and rationale for the decision.

## Organization

Each ADR should reference sources from `documentation/` or `examples/`

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Decision Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [Who made this decision]
**Phase:** [Vision | Mission | Execution | Implementation]

## Context

- [Benefit 1]

**Cons:**
- [Limitation 1]

**Research:**
- [Source from documentation/ or examples/]

### Option 2: [Name]
[Same format]

## Chosen Option

**Selected:** Option X

**Rationale:**
- [Why we chose this]

**Research Support:**
- Official docs: [Link to documentation/]
- Implementation example: [Link to examples/]
- Technical standard: [Link or reference]

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- [What we gain]

**Negative:**
- [What we sacrifice]

**Mitigation:**
- [How we address negatives]

## Implementation Notes

[How will this decision be implemented?]

## References

- [Source 1 from research/]

## Related Upgrades

### Query Router Improvement Plan (October 2025)

The **Query Router Improvement Plan** addresses limitations identified in ADR-003 (Intent-Based Query Routing) with state-of-the-art 2025 approaches:

**Limitations Found:**
- Keyword-based intent classification (63.64% misclassification rate)
- No query rewriting (missing +21-28 point gains)
- Static database weights (no adaptation)
- No GraphRAG hybrid search (missing 99% precision)

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Semantic Router (10ms classification)
- Query rewriting (Microsoft benchmarks)
- Adaptive weights (contextual bandits)
- GraphRAG hybrid search (Neo4j + Qdrant unified)
