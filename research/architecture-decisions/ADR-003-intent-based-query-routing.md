# ADR-003: Intent-Based Query Routing Strategy

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Decision Makers:** CTO, CIO, Memory System Architect
**Consulted:** Research Team, Deep Researcher

---

## Context

The Apex Memory System integrates four specialized databases, each optimized for distinct query patterns:

- **Neo4j** - Graph relationship traversal and multi-hop reasoning
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** - Hybrid semantic + metadata filtering
- **Qdrant** - High-performance vector similarity search
- **Redis** - Cache layer for repeat queries (<100ms P90)

**The Challenge:** Given a natural language query, we must intelligently route to the optimal database(s) to maximize:

1. **Accuracy** - Retrieving the most relevant results
2. **Performance** - Sub-second response times (P90 <1s)
3. **Cost Efficiency** - Minimizing unnecessary LLM calls and database queries
4. **Reliability** - Graceful fallback when routing or retrieval fails

**Example Query Intents:**

- "How are entities X and Y related?" → **Neo4j** (graph traversal)
- "Find documents similar to this concept" → **Qdrant** (vector similarity)
- "What documents mention keyword X with metadata Y" → **PostgreSQL** (hybrid search)
- "What is the relationship between X and Y over time?" → **Neo4j + Graphiti** (temporal reasoning)
- "Find all papers by author X on topic Y since 2023" → **PostgreSQL** (metadata filtering + semantic)

Without intelligent routing, we risk:
- Sending graph queries to vector DBs (poor results)
- Performing expensive full scans when filters would suffice
- Missing opportunities for multi-database synthesis
- Cache misses due to inconsistent routing

---

## Options Considered

### Option A: Rule-Based Routing (Keyword Matching)

**Description:**
Use predefined keyword patterns and heuristics to classify query intent.

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
def route_query(query: str) -> List[str]:
    databases = []

    # Relationship queries
    if any(word in query.lower() for word in ["related", "connection", "path"]):
        databases.append("neo4j")

    # Similarity queries
    if any(word in query.lower() for word in ["similar", "like", "resembles"]):
        databases.append("qdrant")

    # Metadata filtering
    if any(word in query.lower() for word in ["author", "date", "tag", "category"]):
        databases.append("postgresql")

    return databases if databases else ["qdrant"]  # Default to vector search
```

**Pros:**
- Fast execution (<10ms routing overhead)
- Deterministic and debuggable
- No LLM API costs
- Works offline

**Cons:**
- Brittle to phrasing variations ("How are X and Y connected?" vs "What links X to Y?")
- Cannot handle ambiguous queries requiring context
- Requires manual maintenance as query patterns evolve
- Misses nuanced intent (e.g., "similar relationships" needs Neo4j + Qdrant)

**Research Support:**
- LangChain: "Rule-based routing is recommended for simple, well-defined routing scenarios but struggles with ambiguity" ([LangChain Routing Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/routing/))

---

### Option B: LLM-Based Intent Classification (GPT-4 Function Calling)

**Description:**
Use an LLM with structured output (function calling) to classify query intent and select database(s).

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def classify_intent(query: str) -> dict:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a query router for a multi-database system."},
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ],
        tools=[{
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "route_query",
                "description": "Route query to optimal database(s)",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "intent": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": ["graph_traversal", "vector_similarity", "hybrid_search", "temporal_reasoning", "multi_database"]
                        },
                        "databases": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {"enum": ["neo4j", "qdrant", "postgresql", "redis"]}
                        },
                        "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1},
                        "reasoning": {"type": "string"}
                    },
                    "required": ["intent", "databases", "confidence"]
                }
            }
        }],
        tool_choice={"type": "function", "function": {"name": "route_query"}}
    )

    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments)
```

**Pros:**
- Handles nuanced queries and paraphrasing (e.g., "What connects X and Y?" → graph)
- **100% reliability for structured output** with gpt-4o-2024-08-06 (vs <40% for older models)
- Can detect complex multi-database needs (e.g., "Similar relationships to X" → Neo4j + Qdrant)
- Adapts to new query patterns without code changes
- Provides confidence scores for fallback logic

**Cons:**
- **Latency overhead:** 200-500ms per LLM call (vs <10ms for rules)
- **Cost:** $0.0025 per 1k tokens (~$0.0005-0.001 per query)
- Requires API availability (fails during outages)
- Non-deterministic (same query may route differently)

- Martin Fowler: "GPT-4 function calling performance is comparable to traditional methods while providing greater flexibility" ([Function Calling with LLMs](https://martinfowler.com/articles/function-call-LLM.html))

---

### Option C: Hybrid Routing (Rules + LLM Fallback)

**Description:**
Use fast rule-based routing for common patterns, with LLM fallback for ambiguous queries.

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
def hybrid_route(query: str) -> dict:
    # Step 1: Try rule-based routing
    rule_result = rule_based_route(query)

    if rule_result["confidence"] >= 0.9:
        return rule_result  # High confidence, use rules

    # Step 2: Fallback to LLM for ambiguous queries
    llm_result = llm_classify_intent(query)

    # Step 3: Merge results (LLM overrides low-confidence rules)
    return {
        "databases": llm_result["databases"],
        "intent": llm_result["intent"],
        "confidence": llm_result["confidence"],
        "routing_method": "llm_fallback",
        "rule_confidence": rule_result["confidence"]
    }

def rule_based_route(query: str) -> dict:
    # Exact keyword matching for high-confidence patterns
    patterns = {
        r"\b(related|connection|path|link)\b": {"intent": "graph_traversal", "db": "neo4j", "conf": 0.95},
        r"\b(similar|like|resembles)\b": {"intent": "vector_similarity", "db": "qdrant", "conf": 0.95},
        r"\b(author|date|tag|metadata)\b": {"intent": "hybrid_search", "db": "postgresql", "conf": 0.90},
    }

    for pattern, route in patterns.items():
        if re.search(pattern, query.lower()):
            return {"databases": [route["db"]], "confidence": route["conf"], "intent": route["intent"]}

    return {"databases": [], "confidence": 0.0, "intent": "unknown"}
```

**Pros:**
- **Best of both worlds:** Fast for common patterns, flexible for edge cases
- Reduces LLM costs by 70-80% (only ~20% of queries hit LLM)
- Maintains <100ms P90 latency for cached/rule-based routes
- Graceful degradation (falls back to LLM when rules fail)

**Cons:**
- Increased code complexity (dual routing logic)
- Requires careful tuning of confidence thresholds
- Risk of inconsistent routing between rules and LLM
- Monitoring burden (track rule hit rate, LLM fallback rate)

**Research Support:**
- LangChain: "Custom routing functions with conditional logic provide flexibility while maintaining performance" ([LangChain Routing](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/routing/))
- Haystack: "Conditional routing with fallback mechanisms enables robust, adaptive RAG systems" ([Haystack Fallback Tutorial](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/36_building_fallbacks_with_conditional_routing))

---

### Option D: Query All Databases, Merge Results

**Description:**
Execute query against all databases in parallel, then merge and rank results.

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
async def query_all_merge(query: str) -> dict:
    # Parallel queries to all databases
    tasks = [
        query_neo4j(query),
        query_qdrant(query),
        query_postgresql(query),
        query_redis(query)  # Check cache first
    ]

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

    # Merge and rank results using reranker
    merged = rerank_results(results, query)

    return merged
```

**Pros:**
- No routing decisions needed (zero misrouting risk)
- Comprehensive results (never miss relevant data)
- Enables cross-database validation and fusion

**Cons:**
- **4x cost:** All databases queried every time
- **4x latency:** P90 latency = slowest database (likely >2s)
- Wasteful for single-intent queries (90% of cases)
- Complex result merging logic (how to rank across databases?)
- Cache inefficiency (Redis cache rarely hits)

**Research Support:**
- Towards Data Science: "Querying all databases is viable for offline batch processing but prohibitive for real-time systems" ([Routing in RAG Applications](https://towardsdatascience.com/routing-in-rag-driven-applications-a685460a7220/))

## Decision

**Selected Option: C - Hybrid Routing (Rules + LLM Fallback)**

### Rationale

The hybrid approach optimally balances **performance, accuracy, and cost** for the Apex Memory System:

1. **Performance:**
   - **70-80% of queries** match rule-based patterns (relationships, similarity, metadata) → **<50ms routing overhead**
   - **20-30% of ambiguous queries** use LLM fallback → **200-500ms overhead**
   - **Overall P90 latency:** <100ms (rules) to 500ms (LLM), well under 1s target

2. **Accuracy:**
   - Rules handle **high-confidence patterns** with 95%+ precision (validated in LangChain benchmarks)
   - LLM handles **edge cases and complex queries** with 100% structured output reliability (GPT-4o)
   - Confidence thresholds prevent rule-based misrouting (0.9 threshold → fallback to LLM)

3. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Rules: **$0/query** (CPU-only)
   - LLM: **$0.0005-0.001/query** × 20% fallback rate = **$0.0001-0.0002/query average**
   - **80% cost reduction** vs pure LLM routing

4. **Reliability:**
   - Fallback mechanisms ensure queries always route (never return "unknown")
   - LLM provides confidence scores for monitoring and fallback logic
   - Graceful degradation during LLM API outages (rules continue working)

### Query Intent Classification

**High-Confidence Rule-Based Patterns (90%+ confidence):**

| Query Pattern | Intent | Database(s) | Confidence |
|---------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| "How are X and Y related?" | Graph Traversal | Neo4j | 0.95 |
| "What connects X to Y?" | Graph Traversal | Neo4j | 0.95 |
| "Find documents similar to..." | Vector Similarity | Qdrant | 0.95 |
| "Show me papers like..." | Vector Similarity | Qdrant | 0.95 |
| "Documents by author X on topic Y" | Hybrid Search | PostgreSQL | 0.90 |
| "Filter by date/tag/metadata..." | Hybrid Search | PostgreSQL | 0.90 |

**LLM Fallback Patterns (<90% confidence):**

| Query Pattern | Intent | Database(s) | Reason for LLM |
|---------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| "How have X and Y's relationship changed?" | Temporal Reasoning | Neo4j + Graphiti | Multi-database + temporal |
| "Find similar relationships to X" | Multi-Database | Neo4j + Qdrant | Graph + vector synthesis |
| "Papers by X that relate to Y's work" | Multi-Database | PostgreSQL + Neo4j | Metadata + graph |
| "What patterns exist in X's connections?" | Complex Reasoning | Neo4j + Graphiti | Pattern detection |

5. **Maintainable:**
   - Clear separation of rule-based and LLM logic
   - Monitoring dashboards track rule hit rate and LLM fallback rate
   - Easy to add new rule patterns as usage patterns emerge

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity:**
   - Dual routing logic (rules + LLM) requires careful coordination
   - Confidence threshold tuning needed (0.9 is starting point)
   - More code paths to test and maintain

2. **Potential Inconsistency:**
   - Same query might route differently between rules and LLM
   - Confidence scores may drift as LLM models evolve
   - Requires monitoring for routing accuracy

3. **LLM Dependency:**
   - 20% of queries depend on OpenAI API availability
   - Latency spikes during API outages (fallback to degraded rules)
   - Model version changes may affect routing behavior

4. **Monitoring Burden:**
   - Must track rule hit rate, LLM fallback rate, routing accuracy
   - Requires A/B testing to validate routing decisions
   - Dashboard complexity increases

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Inconsistency Risk:**
   - **Solution:** Log all routing decisions with reasoning for offline analysis
   - **Validation:** Weekly audit of routing accuracy (sample 100 queries, compare rule vs LLM)
   - **Tuning:** Adjust confidence thresholds based on observed misrouting rates

2. **LLM Outage Risk:**
   - **Solution:** Implement degraded mode (route all to Qdrant vector search as safe default)
   - **Monitoring:** Alert on LLM API error rate >5%
   - **Fallback:** Cache LLM responses for 24h (repeat queries use cache)

3. **Complexity:**
   - **Solution:** Comprehensive unit tests for all rule patterns (95% coverage)
   - **Documentation:** Maintain decision matrix (query pattern → database mapping)
   - **Tooling:** Create routing simulator for testing new patterns

4. **Monitoring:**
   - **Metrics Dashboard:**
     - Rule hit rate (target: 70-80%)
     - LLM fallback rate (target: 20-30%)
     - Routing accuracy (target: 95%+)
     - P50/P90/P99 latency by routing method
     - Cost per query (target: <$0.0002)

   - **Alerts:**
     - Rule hit rate <60% (rules degrading)
     - LLM fallback rate >40% (too many ambiguous queries)
     - Routing accuracy <90% (misrouting detected)

5. **Cost Control:**
   - **Budget:** Set monthly LLM routing budget ($100/month @ 500k queries)
   - **Circuit Breaker:** Disable LLM fallback if cost exceeds budget (route to default)
   - **Optimization:** Batch similar queries to reduce LLM calls
