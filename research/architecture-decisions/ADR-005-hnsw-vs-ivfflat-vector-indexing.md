# ADR-005: HNSW vs IVFFlat for Vector Indexing

## Status
**Proposed** - Awaiting Phase 3.5 Review Board approval

## Context

The Apex Memory System requires high-performance approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search across multiple vector databases to support semantic similarity queries, entity relationship discovery, and temporal pattern detection. We must choose appropriate vector indexing algorithms for:

1. **PostgreSQL + pgvector** - Metadata search and hybrid semantic queries
2. **Qdrant** - High-performance dedicated vector similarity search

The system must meet the following performance targets:
- **Query latency:** <1s for 90% of queries (P90)
- **Cache hit rate:** >70% for repeat queries
- **Ingestion throughput:** 10+ documents/second parallel processing
- **Recall accuracy:** >90% for practical production use

We need to evaluate two primary vector indexing algorithms:
- **IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat compression)** - Cluster-based approximate search
- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** - Graph-based approximate search

## Decision Drivers

1. **Query Performance** - Sub-second response times for vector similarity search
2. **Recall Accuracy** - Maintain >90% recall for production quality results
3. **Build Time** - Reasonable index construction time for continuous ingestion
4. **Memory Efficiency** - Fit within allocated database resources
5. **Scalability** - Handle growing document corpus (target: millions of vectors)
6. **Maintenance Overhead** - Minimal operational complexity
7. **Hybrid Search Support** - Enable combination with keyword/filter searches

## Options Considered

### Option A: IVFFlat for Both Databases

**Algorithm Overview:**
- Partitions dataset into clusters using k-means clustering
- Stores cluster centroids as "inverted file"
- Search probes closest clusters to query vector
- Linear scan within selected clusters

**Advantages:**
- Fast index build times (12-42x faster than HNSW)
- Lower memory consumption
- Simpler parameter tuning
- Smaller index size (257MB vs 729MB for 1M vectors)

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower query performance (2.6 QPS vs 40.5 QPS for 1M vectors)
- Requires training phase before index creation
- Search time grows linearly with number of probes
- Less effective for dynamic datasets with frequent updates

### Option B: HNSW for Both Databases

**Algorithm Overview:**
- Builds multi-layer graph structure (hierarchical proximity graphs)
- Upper layers sparse with far connections, lower layers dense with near connections
- Greedy search navigates from top to bottom layers
- Achieves logarithmic complexity scaling

**Advantages:**
- Superior query performance (15.5x faster: 40.5 QPS vs 2.6 QPS)
- Better recall/performance tradeoff
- No training phase required - can build immediately
- Handles dynamic data better (incremental updates)
- Logarithmic search complexity scales with dataset size
- Industry-proven (state-of-the-art performance)

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower build times (12-42x slower than IVFFlat)
- Higher memory consumption (2.8-4.5x larger index)
- More complex parameter tuning (m, ef_construction, ef_search)
- Requires more `maintenance_work_mem` during construction

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (HNSW in Qdrant, IVFFlat in pgvector)

**Rationale:**
- Use HNSW in Qdrant for dedicated high-speed vector search
- Use IVFFlat in pgvector for hybrid queries with metadata filters
- Optimize each database for its primary use case

**Advantages:**
- Leverages strengths of both algorithms
- Reduces PostgreSQL memory pressure
- Faster index builds for metadata-enriched searches

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased complexity in system architecture
- Inconsistent behavior across databases
- Harder to benchmark and optimize holistically
- Potential confusion for development team

## Decision

**Selected Option: Option B - HNSW for Both Databases**

We will use HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for both PostgreSQL pgvector and Qdrant vector databases.

### Rationale

1. **Query Performance is Critical** - The 15.5x query speed advantage directly supports our <1s P90 latency target. At 40.5 QPS vs 2.6 QPS (benchmarked on 1M vectors), HNSW provides the throughput needed for production workloads.

2. **Recall Accuracy Excellence** - HNSW consistently achieves >95% recall in benchmarks, exceeding our 90% minimum requirement while maintaining sub-second response times.

3. **Scalability for Growth** - Logarithmic search complexity means HNSW performance degrades gracefully as dataset grows to millions of vectors. IVFFlat's linear probe scaling would become problematic.

4. **Dynamic Data Support** - Continuous document ingestion requires incremental index updates. HNSW supports this natively without retraining, while IVFFlat requires periodic rebuilds.

5. **Industry Standard** - HNSW is the algorithm of choice for production vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus). Choosing the same algorithm reduces operational risk.

6. **Build Time is Acceptable** - While slower (12-42x), index builds are one-time or incremental operations. Query performance affects every user interaction, making it the higher priority.

7. **Memory is Manageable** - Modern PostgreSQL and Qdrant deployments can accommodate HNSW's memory requirements (2.8-4.5x larger indexes) through appropriate provisioning.

### Trade-off Acceptance

We accept the following trade-offs:
- **Longer initial index build** - Mitigated by incremental updates and background processing
- **Higher memory consumption** - Addressed through capacity planning and monitoring
- **Complex parameter tuning** - Documented configurations and proven defaults reduce risk

## Configuration Recommendations

### PostgreSQL pgvector HNSW

**Default Configuration (Good Starting Point):**
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

**Production-Optimized Configuration:**
```sql
-- For high-dimensional embeddings (e.g., OpenAI ada-002: 1536 dimensions)
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (
    m = 24,                    -- Higher m for better accuracy on high-dim data
    ef_construction = 100      -- Improved index quality, ~50% slower build
);

-- Query-time tuning (per session or transaction)
SET hnsw.ef_search = 40;       -- Default, balance speed/accuracy
-- SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;   -- Higher recall, slower queries
-- SET hnsw.ef_search = 20;    -- Faster queries, lower recall
```

**Parameter Guidelines:**
- **m (connections per node):**
  - Range: 5-48
  - Default: 16
  - Recommended: 12-16 for low dimensions (<256), 24-32 for high dimensions (>512)
  - Impact: Higher values = better accuracy, more memory, slower build

- **ef_construction (build-time candidates):**
  - Range: 40-200
  - Default: 64
  - Recommended: 64 for balanced, 100-200 for maximum quality
  - Impact: Higher values = better index quality, significantly longer build time
  - Rule: Should be ~2x the value of m

- **ef_search (query-time candidates):**
  - Range: 10-800
  - Default: 40
  - Recommended: 40 for balanced, 100 for high accuracy, 20 for speed
  - Impact: Higher values = better recall, slower queries
  - Note: Can be adjusted per query for flexible speed/accuracy tradeoff

**Memory Requirements:**
```sql
-- Increase maintenance_work_mem for index builds
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '4GB';  -- Default is often 64MB
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Monitor memory usage during index creation
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('documents_embedding_idx'));
```

**Build Best Practices:**
```sql
-- Build index concurrently to avoid blocking writes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY documents_embedding_hnsw_idx
ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 24, ef_construction = 100);

-- Verify index usage
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT * FROM documents
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'::vector
LIMIT 10;
```

### Qdrant HNSW Configuration

**Default Configuration (Good Starting Point):**
```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="apex_vectors",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
        size=1536,  # OpenAI ada-002 embeddings
        distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
        hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(
            m=16,              # Default
            ef_construct=100   # Default
        )
    )
)
```

**Production-Optimized Configuration:**
```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="apex_vectors_optimized",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
        size=1536,
        distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
        hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(
            m=24,                      # Higher for better accuracy
            ef_construct=200,          # Double default for quality
            full_scan_threshold=10000  # When to use brute force (KB)
        ),
        on_disk=False  # Keep in memory for best performance
    ),
    optimizers_config=models.OptimizersConfigDiff(
        indexing_threshold=20000  # Build index after 20k vectors
    )
)
```

**Query-Time Tuning:**
```python
# Search with custom ef parameter
search_result = client.search(
    collection_name="apex_vectors",
    query_vector=[0.1, 0.2, ...],
    limit=10,
    search_params=models.SearchParams(
        hnsw_ef=128,  # Higher than default for better recall
        exact=False   # Use approximate search (faster)
    )
)

# For critical queries requiring maximum accuracy
search_result = client.search(
    collection_name="apex_vectors",
    query_vector=[0.1, 0.2, ...],
    limit=10,
    search_params=models.SearchParams(
        exact=True  # Force exact search (slower, 100% recall)
    )
)
```

**Parameter Guidelines:**
- **m (edges per node):**
  - Default: 16
  - Recommended: 16 for balanced, 24-32 for high accuracy
  - Impact: More edges = more accurate but more memory

- **ef_construct (construction candidates):**
  - Default: 100
  - Recommended: 100-200 for production
  - Impact: Higher = better index quality, slower construction
  - Must be higher than m

- **hnsw_ef (search parameter):**
  - Default: Equal to ef_construct (100)
  - Recommended: 64 for speed, 128 for accuracy, 256 for maximum recall
  - Impact: Higher = better recall, slower search
  - Can be set per query for flexibility

### Tuning Strategy

**Phase 1: Start with Defaults**
```
pgvector:  m=16, ef_construction=64, ef_search=40
Qdrant:    m=16, ef_construct=100, hnsw_ef=100
```

**Phase 2: Benchmark and Adjust**
1. Monitor query latency (target: P90 < 1s)
2. Measure recall accuracy (target: >90%)
3. Track memory usage and index size
4. Adjust ef_search/hnsw_ef first (fastest iteration)

**Phase 3: Optimize for Production**
- If recall < 90%: Increase m and ef_construction (rebuild index)
- If queries too slow: Decrease ef_search/hnsw_ef
- If queries too fast with extra headroom: Increase ef_search/hnsw_ef for better recall
- If memory constrained: Reduce m (rebuild index)

**Trade-off Formula:**
```
Recall ∝ m × ef_construction × ef_search
Build Time ∝ ef_construction²
Query Time ∝ ef_search
Memory ∝ m × num_vectors
```

## Consequences

### Negative

1. **Slower Index Build Times**
   - 12-42x slower than IVFFlat (minutes to hours for large datasets)
   - Impact: Longer initial deployment, slower bulk re-indexing
   - Risk: Delays in development/testing cycles with large datasets

2. **Higher Memory Consumption**
   - 2.8-4.5x larger index size than IVFFlat
   - Impact: Increased infrastructure costs, tighter capacity planning
   - Risk: Out-of-memory errors during build without proper provisioning

3. **Complex Parameter Tuning**
   - More parameters to configure (m, ef_construction, ef_search)
   - Impact: Steeper learning curve for operations team
   - Risk: Suboptimal performance if misconfigured

4. **Resource-Intensive Construction**
   - High `maintenance_work_mem` required during build
   - Impact: May need to increase PostgreSQL memory limits
   - Risk: Build failures on memory-constrained systems

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Build Time Concerns:**
1. **Incremental Indexing** - Build index as documents are ingested, not in bulk
2. **Background Processing** - Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in PostgreSQL
3. **Staged Rollout** - Build indexes during off-peak hours or maintenance windows
4. **Smaller Initial Corpus** - Start with subset of documents, expand gradually

**For Memory Consumption:**
1. **Capacity Planning** - Provision PostgreSQL and Qdrant with 4-8GB RAM minimum
2. **Monitoring** - Set up alerts for memory usage thresholds
3. **Vertical Scaling** - Plan for memory upgrades as corpus grows
4. **On-Disk Storage** - Use Qdrant's on-disk mode if memory becomes critical (with performance trade-off)

**For Parameter Tuning:**
1. **Documented Defaults** - Use research-backed starting configurations
2. **Automated Benchmarking** - Create scripts to test different parameter combinations
3. **Gradual Optimization** - Adjust ef_search first (no rebuild), then m/ef_construction if needed
4. **Team Training** - Document tuning process and provide examples

**For Resource Constraints:**
1. **Index Monitoring** - Track `pg_relation_size()` and Qdrant collection metrics
2. **Cleanup Policies** - Archive or delete old document embeddings
3. **Dimensional Reduction** - Consider PCA/UMAP to reduce vector dimensions
4. **Query Caching** - Use Redis to cache frequent vector searches (supports >70% hit rate target)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration (Week 1)

**PostgreSQL pgvector:**
```sql
-- Update docker-compose.yml PostgreSQL configuration
command:
  - postgres
  - -c
  - shared_preload_libraries=vector
  - -c
  - maintenance_work_mem=4GB  -- Increase for HNSW builds

-- Create HNSW index in migration scripts
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY documents_embedding_hnsw_idx
ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 24, ef_construction = 100);

-- Set session defaults in application code
SET hnsw.ef_search = 40;  -- Balanced default
```

**Qdrant:**
```python
# Update apex_memory/services/qdrant_service.py
async def create_collection(self):
    await self.client.create_collection(
        collection_name="apex_vectors",
        vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
            size=1536,
            distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
            hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(
                m=24,
                ef_construct=200
            )
        )
    )

# Add search parameter configuration
async def search_similar(self, query_vector, limit=10, accuracy="balanced"):
    ef_map = {"fast": 20, "balanced": 64, "accurate": 128}
    return await self.client.search(
        collection_name="apex_vectors",
        query_vector=query_vector,
        limit=limit,
        search_params=models.SearchParams(hnsw_ef=ef_map[accuracy])
    )
```

   - Recall accuracy against ground truth
   - Index build time
   - Memory usage

2. **Load Testing** - Simulate production workload:
   - 100+ concurrent queries
   - Continuous document ingestion
   - Mixed query types (vector, hybrid, filtered)

3. **Validation** - Verify performance targets:
   - P90 latency < 1s
   - Recall > 90%
   - Throughput > 10 docs/sec

### Phase 3: Documentation (Week 2-3)

### Phase 4: Monitoring (Ongoing)

**PostgreSQL Metrics:**
```sql
-- Index usage statistics
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE indexname LIKE '%hnsw%';

-- Index size monitoring
SELECT indexrelname, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid))
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE indexrelname LIKE '%hnsw%';

-- Query performance (requires pg_stat_statements)
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%hnsw%'
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC;
```

**Qdrant Metrics (Prometheus/Grafana):**
- Collection size and point count
- Search latency histograms
- Memory usage per collection
- Index build progress

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- P90 query latency > 1s
- Memory usage > 80% capacity
- Index build failures
- Recall drop below 90%

## Alternatives Considered and Rejected

### Exact k-NN Search (No Index)

**Rejected Because:**
- Query time ~650ms for 1M vectors (too slow)
- Linear scaling makes it impractical for millions of vectors
- Does not meet <1s P90 latency target

**Use Case:** Could be used for very small datasets (<10K vectors) where accuracy is critical

### Product Quantization (PQ)

**Rejected Because:**
- Reduces vector dimensions through lossy compression
- Typically achieves only 85% recall vs 95%+ for HNSW
- Below our 90% recall requirement
- Adds complexity without meeting quality bar

**Use Case:** Consider for massive scale (100M+ vectors) where memory is severely constrained

### ScaNN (Google's ANN Library)

**Rejected Because:**
- Not natively supported by pgvector or Qdrant
- Would require custom integration and maintenance
- Less mature ecosystem compared to HNSW
- No clear performance advantage to justify integration cost

**Use Case:** Potential future consideration if we need to scale beyond HNSW capabilities

### LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)

**Rejected Because:**
- Lower recall accuracy compared to HNSW
- More complex parameter tuning
- Not supported by pgvector or Qdrant
- Primarily useful for extremely high-dimensional data (>10K dims)

**Use Case:** Specialized use cases with ultra-high dimensionality
