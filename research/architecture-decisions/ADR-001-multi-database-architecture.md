# ADR-001: Multi-Database Architecture Choice

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Decision Makers:** CTO, CIO, COO (Phase 3.5 Review Board)
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Infrastructure Team, End Users

---

## Context

The Apex Memory System requires a sophisticated knowledge storage and retrieval architecture to support an intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for AI agents. The system must handle multiple distinct query patterns with different performance characteristics:

### Core Requirements

1. **Graph Relationship Queries** - "Show me all documents connected to Entity X through relationship Y"
2. **Semantic Vector Search** - "Find documents most similar to this query embedding"
3. **Metadata Filtering** - "Retrieve documents where author='Smith' AND date>'2024-01-01'"
4. **Temporal Intelligence** - "What was the state of Entity X on 2024-03-15?" and "How has concept Y evolved over time?"
5. **High-Performance Caching** - "Return results for repeat queries in <100ms"

### Performance Targets

- **P90 query latency:** <1 second for 90% of queries
- **Cache hit rate:** >70% for repeat queries
- **Ingestion throughput:** 10+ documents/second with parallel processing
- **Scalability:** Support for millions of entities and relationships
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime for production workloads

### Problem Statement

**Can a single database technology meet all these requirements effectively, or does the system need specialized databases for each query pattern?**

Traditional single-database approaches force trade-offs:
- Graph databases with vector plugins sacrifice vector search performance
- Vector databases with graph capabilities have limited relationship traversal
- Relational databases with extensions struggle with both graph and vector workloads at scale

---

## Options Considered

### Option A: Single Database (Neo4j with Vector Search Plugin)

**Description:** Use Neo4j as the sole database, leveraging its native graph capabilities and vector search plugin for semantic queries.

**Strengths:**
- **Operational Simplicity** - Single database to manage, monitor, and backup
- **Transaction Consistency** - ACID guarantees within a single system
- **Unified Query Interface** - Cypher queries can combine graph traversal and vector search
- **Lower Infrastructure Costs** - One database cluster vs. multiple systems
- **Faster Initial Development** - Simpler data pipeline and no cross-database coordination

**Weaknesses:**
- **Vector Search Performance** - Neo4j's vector search is not optimized for high-dimensional embeddings at scale
  - Neo4j uses HNSW algorithm but as an add-on, not a core competency
  - Benchmarks show dedicated vector DBs like Qdrant achieve 4x higher RPS [1]
- **Limited Temporal Capabilities** - No native bi-temporal tracking (valid time vs. transaction time)
- **Caching Complexity** - Must implement application-level caching without semantic similarity matching
- **Metadata Query Performance** - Graph queries on metadata filters are less efficient than relational indexes
- **Scalability Concerns** - Single point of failure and scaling bottleneck

**Use Cases:**
- Small-scale prototypes (<100k documents)
- Graph-first applications where vector search is secondary
- Teams with limited DevOps capacity

**Research Support:**
- "Neo4j's vector search allows developers to create vector indexes... supporting vectors up to 4,096 dimensions with cosine and Euclidean similarity functions" [2]
- "Can Neo4j Replace Vector Databases in RAG Pipelines?" - Conclusion: "Neo4j is a powerful tool but specialized vector databases still have advantages for large-scale similarity search" [3]

---

### Option B: Dual Database (Neo4j + Qdrant)

**Description:** Combine Neo4j for graph relationships with Qdrant for high-performance vector search, using shared entity IDs for cross-referencing.

**Strengths:**
- **Best-of-Both-Worlds** - Graph expertise from Neo4j, vector performance from Qdrant
- **Official Neo4j Recommendation** - "Offload embeddings to Qdrant while keeping relationships in Neo4j to handle large or frequently updated embeddings externally" [4]
- **Superior Vector Performance** - Qdrant achieves "highest RPS and lowest latencies in almost all scenarios" with 4x RPS gains [5]
- **GraphRAG Pattern** - Proven architecture for combining semantic similarity with relationship context [6]
- **Moderate Complexity** - Only two systems to coordinate, simpler than full multi-database

**Weaknesses:**
- **No Metadata Query Optimization** - Still requires graph queries for structured metadata filtering
- **No Temporal Intelligence** - Lacks bi-temporal tracking for historical queries
- **No Built-in Caching** - Requires separate caching layer or application-level implementation
- **Cross-Database Consistency** - Must implement Saga pattern for transaction coordination [7]
- **Operational Complexity** - Two databases to monitor, backup, and scale

**Use Cases:**
- Medium-scale applications (100k-10M documents)
- GraphRAG implementations prioritizing vector search and relationship traversal
- Teams comfortable with multi-database operations

**Research Support:**
- "The GraphRAG ingestion pipeline combines a Graph Database and a Vector Database to improve RAG workflows" [6]
- "Qdrant handles vector embeddings and similarity searches, Neo4j manages graph-based relationships and contextual data" [4]
- Integration library: `neo4j-graphrag-python` with `QdrantNeo4jRetriever` [4]

---

### Option C: Multi-Database (Neo4j + PostgreSQL + Qdrant + Redis + Graphiti)

**Description:** Specialized database for each query pattern:
- **Neo4j** - Graph relationships and entity connections
- **Graphiti** - Temporal reasoning layer (built on Neo4j) with bi-temporal tracking
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** - Metadata search with hybrid semantic capabilities
- **Qdrant** - High-performance vector similarity search
- **Redis** - Semantic caching layer with sub-100ms repeat query performance

**Strengths:**
- **Maximum Performance** - Each database optimized for its specific workload
  - Qdrant: 4x RPS for vector search vs. alternatives [5]
  - Redis: 3.2x faster end-to-end response (389ms vs. 1,513ms) [8]
  - PostgreSQL: Efficient B-tree indexes for metadata filtering
  - Graphiti: Sub-second temporal queries with bi-temporal tracking [9]
- **Cost Efficiency** - Redis caching cuts LLM API calls by 30-90% [8]
- **Temporal Intelligence** - Graphiti provides "real-time knowledge graphs with explicit bi-temporal tracking" [9]
- **Scalability** - Independent scaling of each component
  - Vector search can scale independently from graph queries
  - Cache layer can handle read-heavy workloads
- **Fault Tolerance** - Failure in one database doesn't cascade to others
- **Query Optimization** - Intelligent routing to the optimal database for each query type
- **Future-Proof** - Modular architecture allows component upgrades without full system rewrite

**Weaknesses:**
- **High Operational Complexity** - Five databases to manage, monitor, backup, and secure
- **Increased Infrastructure Costs** - More servers, storage, and maintenance overhead
- **Data Consistency Challenges** - Must implement Saga pattern for cross-database transactions [7]
  - Saga compensating transactions for rollback scenarios
  - Eventual consistency model vs. ACID guarantees
- **Complex Data Pipeline** - Parallel writes to multiple databases during ingestion
- **Steeper Learning Curve** - Team must understand five different database technologies
- **Debugging Complexity** - "Complex debugging as service interactions increase" [7]
- **Initial Development Overhead** - Longer time to production vs. single-database approach

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Orchestrated Saga Pattern** - Centralized transaction coordinator for data consistency [7]
- **Docker Compose** - Unified local development environment with all databases pre-configured
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Grafana dashboards for all database metrics
- **Circuit Breakers** - Graceful degradation when one database is unavailable
- **Automated Backups** - Scheduled backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Query Router** - Intelligent abstraction layer hiding database complexity from application code

**Use Cases:**
- Large-scale production systems (10M+ documents)
- Enterprise applications requiring <1s P90 latency
- Systems with diverse query patterns (graph, vector, metadata, temporal, cached)
- Teams with mature DevOps practices

**Research Support:**
- "Distributed shines for high-demand, large-scale search in regulated industries, global workloads" [10]
- "Modular RAG frameworks enable teams to scale components independently" [10]
- "31% of queries to LLM can be cached, resulting in substantial cost savings" [8]
- "Graphiti builds real-time knowledge graphs with continuous, incremental updates" [9]
