## Quick Reference

### Decision Summary

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Routing Strategy** | Hybrid (Rules + LLM Fallback) |
| **Rule Patterns** | Graph, vector, hybrid, temporal (4 categories) |
| **LLM Model** | GPT-4o-2024-08-06 (100% structured output reliability) |
| **Confidence Threshold** | 0.9 (rule → LLM fallback trigger) |
| **Fallback Strategy** | Rule (primary) → LLM (fallback) → Degraded mode (Qdrant default) |

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Rule hit rate | 70-80% | Fast routing for common patterns |
| LLM fallback rate | 20-30% | Accurate routing for edge cases |
| P90 latency | <500ms | Well under 1s system target |
| Routing accuracy | >95% | High-quality database selection |
| Cost per query | <$0.0002 | 80% cost reduction vs pure LLM |
| Cache hit rate | >70% | Consistent routing enables caching |

### Database Routing Matrix

| Query Intent | Database(s) | Confidence | Example Query |
|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Graph Traversal | Neo4j | 0.95 | "How are X and Y related?" |
| Vector Similarity | Qdrant | 0.95 | "Find documents similar to X" |
| Hybrid Search | PostgreSQL | 0.90 | "Papers by author X since 2023" |
| Temporal Reasoning | Neo4j + Graphiti | 0.95 | "How has X changed over time?" |
| Multi-Database | 2+ DBs | Varies | "Similar relationships to X's network" |

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Rule-Based Foundation | Week 1-2 | Rule router, 50+ unit tests, <50ms P90 latency |
| Phase 2: LLM Fallback | Week 3-4 | LLM router, hybrid coordinator, integration tests |
| Phase 3: Monitoring & Tuning | Week 5-6 | Metrics, dashboard, A/B tests, production readiness |
| **Total** | **6 weeks** | Production-ready hybrid routing system |
