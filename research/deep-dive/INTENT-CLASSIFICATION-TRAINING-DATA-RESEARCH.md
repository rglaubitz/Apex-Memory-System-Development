## 1. Training Data Quality Characteristics

### 1.1 Diversity Requirements

**Linguistic Diversity (Source: Rasa NLU Documentation, 2025)**
- Real user messages exhibit natural variation: typos, abbreviations, colloquialisms
- Quote: "Real user messages can be messy, contain typos, and be far from 'ideal' examples"
- **Recommendation:** Include 15-20% deliberately imperfect examples

**Phrasings Per Intent (Source: Genesys NLU Best Practices, 2025)**
- Minimum: 10-15 varied phrasings per intent
- Optimal: 20-30+ phrasings showing word order variations
- **Key Insight:** Word vector similarity means models cluster semantically related phrases

**Domain Coverage (Source: Label Your Data, 2025)**
- Healthcare domain achieved 98% accuracy with domain-specific training
- Transportation/logistics requires industry jargon coverage
- **Finding:** Domain-specific vocabulary more critical than volume for specialized tasks

### 1.2 Class Balance Requirements

**Balance Ratios (Source: Genesys Documentation, 2025)**
- Quote: "Disproportionate numbers of training examples per intent can introduce bias"
- **Recommended Ratio:** Within 1:2 to 1:3 between smallest and largest class
- **Warning:** 1:10+ imbalance leads to majority class bias

**Imbalance Handling (Source: Nature Scientific Reports, 2025)**
- SMOTE variants effective for text classification with imbalanced data
- Transformer embeddings (MiniLMv2) + SMOTE improved F1-scores 12-18%
- **Best Practice:** Use semantic oversampling techniques rather than simple duplication

### 1.3 Edge Case Requirements

**Ambiguous Query Handling (Source: Label Your Data, 2025)**
- Multi-intent support necessary: "track_order + cancel_order"
- Confidence threshold calibration critical
- **Recommendation:** 10-15% of training data should be edge cases/boundary examples

**Inter-Annotator Agreement (Source: Label Your Data, 2025)**
- Test clarity with multiple annotators before scaling
- Cohen's Kappa > 0.7 indicates sufficient label clarity
- **Finding:** Fuzzy labels create fuzzy models regardless of volume

### 4.2 4-Class Classification Specific Guidance

**Graph, Temporal, Semantic, Metadata Categories**

Based on research synthesis:
- **Minimum per class:** 30-50 examples for initial training
- **Recommended per class:** 75-100 examples for production (300-400 total)
- **Optimal per class:** 125-150 examples for mature system (500-600 total)

**Class Balance for Transportation:**
- Expect natural imbalance (semantic queries likely 40-50% of total)
- Maintain minimum 1:3 ratio between smallest (temporal) and largest (semantic)
- Use weighted loss functions to compensate for imbalance

### 4.3 Handling Ambiguous Transportation Queries

**Multi-Intent Examples:**
- "Show me shipment timeline and current location" â†’ Temporal + Semantic
- "Find all late deliveries from ACME Corp" â†’ Temporal + Graph + Metadata

**Hierarchical Classification Approach:**
- Level 1: Primary intent (highest confidence)
- Level 2: Secondary intent (if confidence > 0.3)
- **Recommendation:** Support multi-label classification for 10-15% of queries

**Confidence Calibration:**
- Set rejection threshold at 0.6-0.7 for transportation domain
- Ambiguous queries routed to hybrid approach
- **Finding:** Better to defer than misclassify in production logistics

### 4.4 Transportation-Specific Edge Cases

**Critical Edge Cases to Include:**
1. **Abbreviations:** "ETA," "BOL," "FTL," "LTL" (10-15% of training data)
2. **Temporal ambiguity:** "last week" vs "week 42" (5-10% of data)
3. **Entity variations:** "ACME Corp" vs "ACME Corporation" vs "Acme" (10% of data)
4. **Negations:** "shipments NOT from supplier X" (5% of data)
5. **Comparisons:** "slower than usual" requires temporal context (5% of data)
