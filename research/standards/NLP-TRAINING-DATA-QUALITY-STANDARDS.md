## 2. Dataset Balance and Distribution

### 2.1 Class Imbalance Standards

**Industry Consensus on Imbalance Ratios:**

| Imbalance Ratio | Classification | Recommended Action | Source |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1:1 to 1:3 | Balanced | Standard training | Multiple sources |
| 1:3 to 1:10 | Moderate imbalance | Weighted loss or stratified sampling | PMC 2025 |
| 1:10 to 1:100 | High imbalance | SMOTE/oversampling + cost-sensitive | KNIME 2025 |
| >1:100 | Severe imbalance | Specialized techniques + careful validation | ISI 2024 |

**Minimum Representation Guidelines:**

- **Small datasets (<1000 samples):** Each class should have **≥30 examples** minimum
- **Medium datasets (1000-10,000):** Each class should have **≥100 examples** minimum
- **Large datasets (>10,000):** Each class should represent **≥1% of total** (minimum 100 examples)

**Source Citations:**
- "Handling Data Imbalance in Machine Learning" (ISI-Web 2024)
- "A Review of Machine Learning Methods for Imbalanced Data" (PMC 2025)
- "4 Techniques to Handle Imbalanced Datasets" (KNIME 2025)

### 2.2 Imbalance Handling Techniques

**Best Practices from Industry (2024-2025):**

1. **Resampling Techniques:**
   - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling):** Most widely used (Journal of Big Data 2024)
   - **ADASYN:** Better for handling noise in minority class
   - **Tomek Links + SMOTE:** Combine under/oversampling
   - **Effectiveness:** Can improve F1 score by 15-30% on imbalanced datasets

2. **Algorithmic Approaches:**
   - **Class weighting:** Inverse frequency weighting standard practice
   - **Focal Loss:** Effective for extreme imbalance (>1:100)
   - **Cost-sensitive learning:** Assign misclassification costs

3. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - **Balanced Random Forest:** Sample each tree with balanced subsets
   - **EasyEnsemble:** Multiple balanced subsets
   - **RUSBoost:** Combines boosting with undersampling

**Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data:**

Standard accuracy is misleading. Use instead:
- **F1 Score** (harmonic mean of precision/recall)
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):** -1 to +1 scale
- **PR-AUC:** Area under Precision-Recall curve (preferred over ROC-AUC)
- **Balanced Accuracy:** Average of per-class accuracy

**Source:** "Data Oversampling and Imbalanced Datasets: An Investigation" (Journal of Big Data 2024)

### 2.3 Stratification Best Practices

**Industry Standards:**

1. **Train/Val/Test Splitting:**
   - Maintain class distribution across splits (stratified sampling)
   - Typical split: 70-15-15 or 80-10-10
   - Temporal splitting for time-series: Respect chronological order

2. **Cross-Validation:**
   - **Stratified K-Fold:** Standard practice (k=5 or k=10)
   - Ensures each fold maintains class distribution
   - Critical for small datasets or minority classes

3. **Data Leakage Prevention:**
   - No overlap between train/val/test
   - Group-aware splitting (e.g., same user/entity not in multiple splits)
   - Temporal leakage checks for time-dependent data

## 3. Semantic Triad Framework Validation

### 3.1 Framework Comparison

**Our Semantic Triad Framework:**
- **Cohesion ≥0.70:** Intra-class semantic similarity
- **Separation ≥0.50:** Inter-class semantic distance
- **Ambiguity <10%:** Percentage of ambiguous examples

**Alignment with Industry Standards:**

| Our Metric | Industry Equivalent | Our Threshold | Industry Threshold | Alignment |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Cohesion ≥0.70 | Intra-class cosine similarity | 0.70 | 0.70-0.80 (MTEB) | ✅ **Well aligned** |
| Separation ≥0.50 | Inter-class distance | 0.50 | 0.40-0.50 (ALIGN-SIM) | ✅ **Well aligned** |
| Ambiguity <10% | Inter-annotator disagreement rate | <10% | <10-15% (ACL 2024) | ✅ **Well aligned** |

**Assessment:** Our framework thresholds are **conservative and appropriate** for production NLP systems.

### 3.2 Complementary Metrics to Consider

**Based on industry standards, consider adding:**

1. **Silhouette Score** (cluster quality)
   - Formula: (b - a) / max(a, b) where a=intra-cluster distance, b=nearest-cluster distance
   - Threshold: >0.50 indicates good separation
   - **Benefit:** Single metric combining cohesion + separation

2. **Davies-Bouldin Index** (cluster separation)
   - Lower is better (well-separated clusters have DBI <1.0)
   - Threshold: <1.5 acceptable, <1.0 excellent
   - **Benefit:** Penalizes overlapping clusters

3. **Calinski-Harabasz Score** (variance ratio)
   - Higher is better (>100 generally good)
   - **Benefit:** Measures between-cluster vs. within-cluster variance

4. **Coverage Metrics:**
   - **Concept coverage:** % of target concepts represented
   - **Feature space coverage:** % of feature space explored
   - **Edge case coverage:** % of known edge cases included

**Recommendation:** Add **Silhouette Score ≥0.50** as a fourth metric to complement the Semantic Triad.

**OpenAI's Training Data Guidelines (inferred from public sources):**
- Diversity of sources and perspectives
- Quality filtering (removing low-quality content)
- Deduplication (removing near-duplicates)
- Safety filtering (removing harmful content)
- Consent and licensing compliance

## 4. Edge Case Coverage

### 4.1 How Many Edge Cases Should Training Data Include?

**Industry Guidelines:**

| Dataset Size | Minimum Edge Cases | Recommended Edge Cases | Source |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Small (<1000) | 5-10% | 10-15% | Google ML Testing Guide |
| Medium (1000-10K) | 10% | 15-20% | TestFort AI Testing Guide 2025 |
| Large (>10K) | 10-15% | 20-30% | Multiple sources |

**Edge Case Categories:**

1. **Boundary Cases** (5-10% of data)
   - Examples near decision boundaries
   - Minimal feature differences between classes
   - Challenging for model discrimination

2. **Adversarial Examples** (3-5% of data)
   - Intentionally perturbed inputs
   - Test model robustness
   - Prevent adversarial attacks

3. **Out-of-Distribution Samples** (2-5% of data)
   - Examples at edges of feature space
   - Rare but valid inputs
   - Test generalization

4. **Ambiguous Cases** (5-10% of data)
   - Multiple valid interpretations
   - Low inter-annotator agreement (but still >60%)
   - Represent real-world ambiguity

**Total Recommended:** **15-30% of training data** should represent edge/challenging cases.

### 4.2 Boundary Case Selection Strategies

**Best Practices:**

1. **Uncertainty Sampling:**
   - Train initial model on core data
   - Select samples with highest prediction uncertainty
   - Add to training set and retrain (active learning)

2. **Contrastive Learning:**
   - Identify minimal pairs (same except one feature)
   - Add examples that differ by single critical feature
   - Forces model to learn fine-grained distinctions

3. **Adversarial Generation:**
   - Use FLAN-T5 or similar to generate paraphrases
   - Apply semantic-preserving transformations
   - Validate that meaning is preserved (Mutual Implication >0.85)

4. **Human-in-the-Loop:**
   - Annotators flag challenging examples during labeling
   - Expert review of low-confidence predictions
   - Targeted collection of known failure modes

**Source:** "A Targeted Paraphrasing Approach For Uncovering Edge Cases" (EACL 2024)

### 4.3 Adversarial Examples

**Industry Standards for Adversarial Robustness:**

1. **Adversarial Training:**
   - Include 5-10% adversarial examples in training
   - Use gradient-based perturbations (FGSM, PGD)
   - Mix adversarial and clean examples

2. **Adversarial Evaluation:**
   - Test on held-out adversarial examples
   - Measure accuracy drop under attack
   - **Robustness threshold:** <10% accuracy drop acceptable, <5% excellent

3. **Types of Adversarial Examples for NLP:**
   - **Character-level:** Typos, homoglyphs (e.g., 'a' → 'а' Cyrillic)
   - **Word-level:** Synonym substitution, word reordering
   - **Sentence-level:** Paraphrasing, negation insertion
   - **Semantic:** Meaning-preserving transformations

4. **Defense Mechanisms:**
   - Adversarial training (most effective)
   - Input preprocessing (spell checking, normalization)
   - Ensemble models (harder to fool multiple models)
   - Certified defenses (provable robustness bounds)
