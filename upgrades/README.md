## Active Upgrades

### Temporal Workflow Orchestration

**Status:** 🚀 Active Implementation
**Priority:** High
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (4 phases)
**Research Progress:** 40% (architecture analysis complete)

**Location:** [`active/temporal-implementation/`](active/temporal-implementation/)

**TL;DR:**
Replace custom saga pattern with Temporal.io workflow orchestration for durable, reliable distributed transaction management with automatic retries, compensation, and complete observability.

**Expected Gains:**
- ✅ 99.9% workflow reliability (Temporal SLA)
- ✅ Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ Complete workflow visibility in Temporal UI
- ✅ Pause/resume/cancel long-running operations
- ✅ Zero custom compensation logic (built-in)

**Research Foundation:**
- [Temporal.io Python SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python) - Official documentation
- [Temporal Architecture](https://docs.temporal.io/concepts) - Core concepts
- [ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS-2025.md](ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS-2025.md) - Analysis of workflow orchestration benefits

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Infrastructure setup (Temporal server, Python SDK, workers)
2. **Week 3-4:** Ingestion workflow migration (with gradual rollout 10% → 100%)
3. **Week 5-6:** Query workflow migration (including long-running query support)
4. **Week 7-8:** Monitoring, observability, and Prometheus metrics export
