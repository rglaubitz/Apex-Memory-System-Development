# Upgrades & Improvement Plans

This directory tracks active and planned upgrades to the Apex Memory System, each backed by comprehensive research and phased implementation plans.

## Purpose

The `upgrades/` directory serves as:

1. **Planning Hub** - Detailed improvement plans with research citations
2. **Progress Tracking** - Implementation status and phase tracking
3. **Knowledge Base** - Research summaries and decision rationale
4. **Reference Archive** - Historical upgrades and lessons learned

## Active Upgrades

### Query Router Improvement Plan

**Status:** ‚úÖ Planning Complete ‚Üí üöÄ Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High
**Timeline:** 8 weeks (4 phases)
**Research Foundation:** 5 documents covering 2025 RAG state-of-the-art

**Location:** [`query-router/`](query-router/)

**TL;DR:**
Comprehensive upgrade bringing Apex query routing from current keyword-based approach to 2025 standards with semantic classification, adaptive learning, agentic reasoning, and GraphRAG hybrid search.

**Expected Gains:**
- ‚úÖ +21-28 points relevance improvement (Microsoft benchmarks)
- ‚úÖ 99% precision on relationship queries (GraphRAG)
- ‚úÖ 90ms faster intent classification (Semantic Router)
- ‚úÖ 15-30% accuracy improvement (adaptive learning)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ cache hit rate (semantic caching)

**Research Documents:**
- [Semantic Router](../research/documentation/query-routing/semantic-router.md) - 10ms intent classification
- [Query Rewriting](../research/documentation/query-routing/query-rewriting-rag.md) - Microsoft +21-28 point improvement
- [Agentic RAG 2025](../research/documentation/query-routing/agentic-rag-2025.md) - Autonomous agents paradigm
- [Adaptive Routing](../research/documentation/query-routing/adaptive-routing-learning.md) - Contextual bandits, learned weights
- [GraphRAG](../research/documentation/query-routing/graphrag-hybrid-search.md) - 99% precision hybrid search

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Foundation (semantic classification, query rewriting, analytics)
2. **Week 3-4:** Intelligent routing (adaptive weights, GraphRAG, semantic caching)
3. **Week 5-6:** Agentic evolution (complexity analysis, multi-router, self-correction)
4. **Week 7-8:** Advanced features (multimodal, real-time adaptation)

**Quick Wins:** 5 immediate improvements available (confidence scores, logging, OOS detection, normalization, timing)

## Upgrade Workflow

### 1. Research Phase

**Objective:** Gather high-quality research following source hierarchy

**Activities:**
- Use research team agents to find documentation
- Document findings in `research/documentation/`
- Collect code examples in `research/examples/`
- Track sources in `research/references.md`

**Quality Gate:** CIO validates research quality

### 2. Planning Phase

**Objective:** Create comprehensive improvement plan

**Activities:**
- Identify current flaws and gaps
- Propose phased implementation approach
- Define expected gains and metrics
- Reference research documents
- Create upgrade directory with README + IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md

**Quality Gate:** Review Board (Phase 3.5) validates plan

### 3. Implementation Phase

**Objective:** Execute approved plan

**Activities:**
- Follow phased implementation
- Track progress with TodoWrite
- Update upgrade README with status
- Create ADRs for significant decisions

**Quality Gate:** COO validates execution feasibility

### 4. Testing Phase

**Objective:** Validate improvements against targets

**Activities:**
- Run benchmarks and performance tests
- Compare against expected gains
- Document actual results
- Create test reports

**Quality Gate:** CTO validates technical achievement

### 5. Archive Phase

**Objective:** Preserve knowledge for future reference

**Activities:**
- Move to `archive/` with completion date
- Document lessons learned
- Update metrics and benchmarks
- Create summary for future upgrades
