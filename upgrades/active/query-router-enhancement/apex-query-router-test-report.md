# Apex Memory Query Router Testing Report
## October 25, 2025 - Query Routing Performance Analysis

**Tester:** Claude (AI Assistant) + G (Richard Glaubitz)  
**Test Date:** October 25, 2025  
**System:** Apex Memory MCP v1.0  
**Focus:** Query router intent classification and database selection

---

## Executive Summary

Tested the Apex Memory query router's ability to classify query intent and route to optimal databases. The router performs **excellently for explicit graph queries** (A grade) but struggles with **generic queries** and has **critical failures** in semantic search and temporal pattern endpoints.

**Key Finding:** Router has a metadata bias - defaults to returning documents instead of extracted facts unless query explicitly mentions "relationships" or "connections."

**Overall Grade: B-** (70/100)
- Explicit graph queries: A (95% confidence, correct routing)
- Generic queries: C (defaults to metadata, returns documents)
- Semantic search: F (Qdrant returns null content)
- Temporal patterns: F (API endpoint returns 422 error)

---

## Test Methodology

### Database State
- **Starting State:** Database appeared cleared from Phase 1 & 2 tests
- **Available Data:** 
  - 4 JSON episodes (GPS events, shipments, emails) from Oct 21
  - Origin Transport operational documents (Ag_Exempt PDF)
  - 219 entities in Neo4j
  - 369 relationships (all type "RELATES_TO")
  - 3 test communities

### Testing Approach
Executed two comprehensive tests using `ask_apex` (the intelligent query orchestration tool):

**Test #1:** Generic logistics query (no relationship keywords)
- Query: "What shipments and logistics data exist in the system? Tell me about drivers, cargo, and locations."
- Purpose: Test router behavior with implicit/generic queries
- Expected: Should extract entities and facts
- Result: Returned documents instead of entities

**Test #2:** Explicit graph query (relationship keywords included)
- Query: "What are the relationships between Equipment entities and Customer entities? Show me the connection graph."
- Purpose: Test router with explicit graph terminology
- Expected: Should route to Neo4j/Graphiti
- Result: Perfect routing (0.95 confidence)

## Test Results

### Test #1: Generic Logistics Query ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Query:** "What shipments and logistics data exist in the system? Tell me about drivers, cargo, and locations."

**Router Behavior (5 sub-queries executed by ask_apex):**

| Step | Query | Intent | Confidence | Database(s) | Result Quality |
|------|-------|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | "shipments logistics overview" | metadata | 0.85 | postgres | ‚úÖ Found 2 docs |
| 2 | "drivers information" | metadata | 0.80 | postgres | ‚úÖ Found 2 docs |
| 3 | "cargo shipment items" | **semantic** | 0.70 | postgres + qdrant | ‚ùå Qdrant: 15 null results |
| 4 | "locations warehouses" | metadata | 0.90 | postgres | ‚ùå Irrelevant doc |
| 5 | "relationship analytics" | N/A | N/A | neo4j | ‚úÖ 369 relationships |

**Findings:**

‚úÖ **What Worked:**
- Intent classification functional (distinguishes metadata vs semantic)
- Multi-database queries work (postgres + qdrant in Step 3)
- Confidence scoring varies appropriately (0.70-0.90)
- Analytics endpoint returns data (369 relationships)

‚ùå **What Failed:**

1. **Metadata Bias:** 3 out of 4 queries classified as "metadata"
   - Router favors postgres over graph/semantic databases
   - Returns PDF documents instead of extracted entities/facts
   - Example: Step 2 returned "Ag_Exempt" driver manual instead of driver entities

2. **Qdrant Returns Empty Content:**
   - Step 3 returned 15 results, all with `content: null`
   - UUIDs exist but content not retrievable
   - Suggests indexing issue or incomplete data sync

3. **Document-Focused Results:**
   - Returns operational documents (PDFs) instead of structured data
   - Not returning memories as facts (e.g., "Driver DRV-5678 has X relationships")
   - User expects: entity facts | System returns: PDF manuals

4. **Generic Relationship Types:**
   - All 369 relationships are type "RELATES_TO" (not specific)
   - No "WORKS_FOR", "SUPPLIES_TO", "MANAGES", etc.
   - Graphiti not creating meaningful relationship types

**Documents Returned:**
- "Ag_Exempt" PDF (Driver loading/unloading checklist) - 2 copies
- "test-local-upload" TXT (irrelevant test document)

**Grade: C** - Functional but returns wrong data type

---

### Test #2: Explicit Graph Query ‚úÖ

**Query:** "What are the relationships between Equipment entities and Customer entities? Show me the connection graph."

**Router Behavior (5 sub-queries executed by ask_apex):**

| Step | Query | Intent | Confidence | Database(s) | Result Quality |
|------|-------|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Entity metadata | N/A | N/A | neo4j analytics | ‚úÖ 219 entities |
| 2 | Relationship analytics | N/A | N/A | neo4j | ‚úÖ 369 relationships |
| 3 | **"connections Equipment Customer"** | **graph** | **0.95** | **neo4j + graphiti** | ‚úÖ **50 facts!** |
| 4 | Community analysis | N/A | N/A | neo4j | ‚ö†Ô∏è Test communities |
| 5 | Pattern analysis | N/A | N/A | API endpoint | ‚ùå 422 error |

**Findings:**

‚úÖ **BREAKTHROUGH - Graph Routing Works!**

When query explicitly mentions "relationships" or "connections":
- ‚úÖ Intent: "graph" (0.95 confidence - highest observed!)
- ‚úÖ Routing: Neo4j + Graphiti (multi-database orchestration)
- ‚úÖ Results: 50 **actual relationship facts** from Graphiti

**Sample Facts Retrieved:**
- "OpenHaul serves Bosch as a customer in its logistics operations"
- "Origin Transport serves Brembo as a customer"
- "ACME Corp upgraded to premium tier as a customer"
- "Customer-2 has subscription tier premium"
- "Customer-2 has activity level high"
- "SHIP-2025-10-19-002 is for Acme Manufacturing Corp"
- "Industrial equipment parts are for Acme Manufacturing Corp"

**Entity Analytics:**
- 219 total entities
- Type distribution: 174 Unknown, 18 Customer, 12 Equipment, 9 Person, 5 Invoice
- Top entities by relationship count:
  - ACME Corp: 120 relationships
  - OpenHaul Logistics: 62 relationships (Equipment type)
  - Origin Transport: 33 relationships (Equipment type)
  - Richard Glaubitz: 25 relationships (Person type)

**Relationship Analytics:**
- 369 total relationships
- Equipment ‚Üí Customer: 12 direct relationships
- Equipment ‚Üí Equipment: 7 relationships
- Customer ‚Üí Customer: 4 relationships

**Grade: A** - Perfect routing and relevant results

## Critical Issues Discovered

### üö® CRITICAL: Metadata Routing Bias

**Issue:** Router defaults to "metadata" intent unless query explicitly mentions relationships/connections

**Evidence:**
- Test #1: 75% of queries classified as "metadata" (3 out of 4)
- Returns documents instead of extracted entities/facts
- Phase 1 finding confirmed: "Defaults to metadata routing (finds documents instead of recent memories)"

**Impact:** 
- Users asking about entities get PDF documents
- Extracted knowledge not being surfaced
- Graph database underutilized

**Fix Required:**
- Improve intent classification for implicit graph queries
- Bias toward graph/semantic search when entities mentioned
- Classify queries with entity types (drivers, customers, equipment) as "graph" not "metadata"

**Suggested Intent Rules:**
```
IF query contains: ["drivers", "customers", "suppliers", "equipment", "people"]
AND query does NOT explicitly request documents/files
THEN classify as: "graph" (not "metadata")
```

---

### üö® CRITICAL: Qdrant Returns Null Content

**Issue:** Semantic similarity search returns UUIDs but content is always null

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "uuid": "255a7b6e-9023-53f1-b87a-ebd0fe0db864",
  "title": "Untitled",
  "content": null,
  "score": 0.365,
  "sources": ["qdrant"]
}
```

**Impact:**
- Semantic search completely non-functional
- Cannot find similar documents
- One of 4 databases not working

**Hypothesis:**
- Qdrant vectors indexed but content not stored/retrieved
- Incomplete data sync between PostgreSQL and Qdrant
- Content retrieval logic broken

**Fix Required:**
- Debug Qdrant indexing pipeline
- Verify content storage in Qdrant
- Test content retrieval logic

---

### üö® CRITICAL: Temporal Pattern Endpoint Broken

**Issue:** `/api/v1/patterns/aggregation/change-frequency` returns 422 error

**Evidence:**
- Failed in Test #1 (Step 5 of ask_apex)
- Failed in Test #2 (Step 5 of ask_apex)
- Also failed in Phase 1 & 2 testing

**Error:**
```
Client error '422 Unprocessable Entity'
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot analyze how relationships change over time
- Temporal pattern detection non-functional
- ask_apex fails 1 out of 5-10 queries

**Fix Required:**
- Debug endpoint or remove from routing
- If keeping: fix validation logic
- If removing: update ask_apex to skip this endpoint

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Generic Relationship Types

**Issue:** All 369 relationships are type "RELATES_TO" (not specific)

**Evidence:**
```json
"type_distribution": {
  "RELATES_TO": 369
}
```

**Expected:**
- "WORKS_FOR" (person ‚Üí company)
- "SUPPLIES_TO" (supplier ‚Üí customer)
- "MANAGES" (person ‚Üí person)
- "ORDERED_FROM" (customer ‚Üí supplier)
- "CONTAINS" (shipment ‚Üí cargo)

**Impact:**
- Graph lacks semantic meaning
- Cannot query specific relationship types
- Reduces graph database value

**Hypothesis:**
- Graphiti not configured to extract relationship types
- LLM prompt not generating specific relationships
- Extraction pipeline needs tuning

**Fix Required:**
- Review Graphiti relationship extraction prompt
- Add relationship type taxonomy
- Test with few-shot examples

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: Test Communities Not Real

**Issue:** Communities are "Test Community 1, 2, 3" with generic summaries

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "name": "Test Community 1",
  "summary": "A test community for development purposes",
  "member_count": 3
}
```

**Impact:**
- Community detection not providing business value
- Cannot identify thematic clusters (e.g., "Customers", "Equipment", "Invoicing")

**Fix Required:**
- Run Leiden algorithm for real community detection
- Or: Generate community names/summaries from member entities

‚úÖ **Temporal pattern endpoint broken** - 422 error persists  
‚úÖ **Generic relationship types** - Still only "RELATES_TO"  
‚úÖ **Test communities** - No real clustering yet

### New Issues Discovered
üÜï **Qdrant returns null content** - Not tested in Phase 1 & 2  
üÜï **Router performs excellently on explicit graph queries** - New positive finding

### Fixed Since Phase 1 & 2
- Entity resolution still working (consolidated Richard/G/Richard Glaubitz)
- Graph health remains 100/100
- No duplicate entities created

---

## Conclusion

The Apex Memory query router demonstrates **strong technical capabilities** with room for improvement in intent classification. The routing system correctly identifies explicit graph queries and orchestrates multi-database searches effectively. However, the **metadata bias** limits the system's ability to surface extracted knowledge for generic queries.

**Production Readiness:**
- ‚úÖ Ready for users who understand graph query syntax
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs tuning for general-audience queries
- ‚ùå Semantic search (Qdrant) must be fixed before production

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix critical issues (Qdrant, temporal endpoint)
2. Retune intent classification
3. Run Phase 3 stress tests (cache, volume, concurrency)
