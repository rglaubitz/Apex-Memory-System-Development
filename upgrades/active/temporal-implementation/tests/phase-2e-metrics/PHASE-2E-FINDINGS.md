## Finding #1: Prometheus Metrics Not Exported Until Used

**Observation:**

When testing `/metrics` endpoint before running any workflows:
- Only 1/26 Temporal metrics appears in output: `apex_temporal_relationships_total`
- The other 25 metrics are defined in code but don't appear in Prometheus export

**Root Cause:**

This is **EXPECTED Prometheus behavior**, not a bug:
- Prometheus only exports metrics that have been initialized (incremented/set/observed at least once)
- Metrics defined in code but never used don't appear in `/metrics` output
- This is a feature, not a bug - it prevents metric namespace pollution

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep "apex_temporal"
# HELP apex_temporal_relationships_total Total temporal relationships created
# TYPE apex_temporal_relationships_total counter

$ curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep -E "^apex_temporal"
# (no output - no values)
```

**Implications for Testing:**

Phase 2E tests CANNOT validate metrics export without first running workflows. The test strategy must be:

1. **Run workflows first** (Phase 2D tests or dedicated workflow run)
2. **THEN validate** metrics appear in `/metrics` output
3. **Verify** metric values are correct

**Revised Test Approach:**

Instead of testing "are metrics defined?", test:
- "Do metrics increment when workflows run?"
- "Do metric values match expected behavior?"
- "Are all activities instrumented correctly?"

## Finding #2: Metrics Definition vs Export Gap

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ All 26 Temporal metrics are **defined** in `metrics.py`
- ‚úÖ All metrics have correct types (Counter, Histogram, Gauge)
- ‚úÖ All metrics have HELP documentation
- ‚ùå Only 1 metric appears in Prometheus export (before workflows run)

**Why This Matters:**

If activities are NOT instrumented (not calling metrics.inc(), metrics.observe(), etc.), then metrics will NEVER appear, even after workflows run. This is a critical gap to validate.

**Test Strategy:**

1. Run a single test workflow
2. Check which metrics incremented
3. If metrics still missing ‚Üí activities not instrumented (BUG)
4. If metrics present ‚Üí instrumentation working (PASS)

## Finding #3: Phase 2E Depends on Phase 2D

**Dependency Chain:**

```
Phase 2D (Load Tests)
   ‚Üì Runs 250 workflows with real DBs
   ‚Üì Populates all metrics with data
Phase 2E (Metrics Validation)
   ‚Üì Validates metrics were collected
   ‚Üì Validates Prometheus scraping
   ‚Üì Validates Grafana dashboard
```

**Recommendation:**

Phase 2E should be run AFTER Phase 2D, using Phase 2D's workflow execution to populate metrics.

**Alternative:**

Run a small dedicated workflow (1-5 documents) at the start of Phase 2E to populate metrics, then validate.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Document expected Prometheus behavior (this file)
2. ‚è≥ Run Phase 2D workflows to populate metrics
3. ‚è≥ Re-test `/metrics` endpoint after workflows run
4. ‚è≥ Validate all 26 metrics now appear
5. ‚è≥ Create test that runs workflow + validates metrics
6. ‚è≥ Test Prometheus scraping
7. ‚è≥ Test Grafana dashboard

---

**Status:** This is expected behavior, not a bug.
**Action Required:** Run workflows before validating metrics export.
