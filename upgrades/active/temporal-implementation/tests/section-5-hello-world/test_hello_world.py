"""Hello World workflow tests for Temporal.io integration validation.

These tests verify that the GreetingWorkflow executes correctly end-to-end,
demonstrating basic Temporal concepts (Section 5 of 17).

Tests verify:
- Workflow execution (end-to-end)
- Activity execution (isolated)
- Retry policy configuration
- Timeout enforcement
- Logging functionality
- Worker startup
- Temporal UI visibility
- Event history
- Edge case handling
