### HANDOFF-WEEK4-DAY1-PARTIAL.md
**From:** Week 3 Complete (90% overall)
**To:** Week 4 Day 1 Continuation
**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Upgrade:** Graphiti + JSON Integration
**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL/INCOMPLETE** - Context window limit approaching

**Key Handoffs:**
- Week 3 100% complete (Staging Lifecycle finished)
- Week 4 Day 1 started but INCOMPLETE (~20% done)
- DocumentIngestionWorkflow partially updated (Step 6 NOT added)
- Tests NOT created yet
- 179 baseline tests passing

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Updated workflow imports (pull_and_stage, cleanup_staging)
- ✅ Updated workflow signature (source_location instead of bucket/prefix)
- ✅ Updated Step 1 (S3 download → staging)
- ✅ Updated step numbers (1/6 through 5/6)

**Work Remaining (CRITICAL):**
- ⏳ Add Step 6: cleanup_staging_activity (code provided in handoff)
- ⏳ Update success return (add staging_cleaned field)
- ⏳ Update error handler (cleanup failed staging)
- ⏳ Create 3 integration tests
- ⏳ Run tests and verify baseline

**Next Session:**
- Continue Day 1 completion (~2 hours remaining)
- Read HANDOFF-WEEK4-DAY1-PARTIAL.md for exact code to add
- Use "Start Command" from handoff for instant continuation

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This handoff was created due to context window limits. The work is INCOMPLETE and must be finished in next session.

## Purpose

Handoff documents ensure:
- **Context Preservation** - Key decisions and implementation details captured
- **Continuity** - Smooth transition between sections
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Future contributors understand progression
- **Quality Gate** - Section completion criteria documented

## Structure

Each handoff document includes:
- **Section Summary** - What was accomplished
- **Key Deliverables** - Code, tests, documentation created
- **Decisions Made** - Important architectural choices
- **Known Issues** - Outstanding concerns or technical debt
- **Next Section** - What comes next and prerequisites
