# Query Router Advanced Features

**Status:** üìù Planning Complete | Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** Non-Critical (Nice to Have)
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Goal:** Advanced Graphiti features (GraphRAG community detection, query explanation, temporal analytics, graph analytics)

---

## Quick Start

**For implementers:**
1. Read [IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md](IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md) - Understand the problem and approach (5 min)
2. Follow [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Step-by-step implementation guide (3-4 weeks)
3. Run tests per [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) - Validate all features working (1 hour)
4. If issues arise, check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common problems and solutions

**For reviewers:**
1. Review [IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md](IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md) - Goals and success metrics
2. Check [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) - Validation criteria and expected outputs

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Query Router is production-ready (98-99% accuracy) but underutilizes 30% of Graphiti capabilities

**Example (Current - Missing Community Detection):**

```
Query: "Find all equipment-related issues"

Current Routing:
‚Üí Neo4j: Equipment entities
‚Üí Graphiti: Equipment mentions
‚Üí Qdrant: Equipment-related documents

Missing:
‚ùå Community detection (clusters of related equipment)
‚ùå Community summaries (auto-generated overviews)
‚ùå Cross-community patterns
```

**Problem:** Without community detection, the query router cannot:
- Group related equipment into logical clusters
- Provide high-level summaries of equipment communities
- Detect patterns across communities (e.g., "all heavy equipment has similar failure modes")

---

**Desired State:** Full Graphiti capability utilization with community detection, query explanations, and advanced analytics

**Example (Desired - With All Features):**

```
Query: "Find all equipment-related issues"

Enhanced Routing:
‚Üí Neo4j: Equipment entities
‚Üí Graphiti: Hybrid search + community detection
‚Üí Qdrant: Equipment-related documents
‚Üí Community Analysis: Clusters equipment into logical communities

Results:
{
  "entities": [
    {"name": "CAT 950 Loader", "type": "Equipment", "community": "Heavy Equipment"},
    {"name": "Komatsu D65", "type": "Equipment", "community": "Heavy Equipment"},
    {"name": "Volvo VNL 780", "type": "Equipment", "community": "Transportation"}
  ],
  "communities": [
    {
      "name": "Heavy Equipment",
      "summary": "Construction equipment community with 12 machines, primarily used for earth-moving operations",
      "members": 12,
      "common_issues": ["hydraulic failures", "track wear"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Transportation",
      "summary": "Fleet vehicles for long-haul transportation, 28 trucks total",
      "members": 28,
      "common_issues": ["brake wear", "engine diagnostics"]
    }
  ],
  "patterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "Heavy equipment shows 3√ó higher maintenance costs in winter months",
      "confidence": 0.89
    }
  ],
  "explanation": {
    "why_these_results": "Query classified as 'graph' intent, routed to Neo4j + Graphiti for relationship discovery. Community detection identified 2 primary equipment clusters based on usage patterns and shared maintenance history.",
    "confidence": 0.94,
    "alternative_queries": [
      "Show me heavy equipment maintenance trends",
      "What are the common issues for transportation fleet?"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** Comprehensive insights with community clustering, pattern detection, and LLM-generated explanations.

## Solution Overview

### What We're Building

**1. Community Detection & GraphRAG** (`apex_memory.query_router.community_manager`)

- Enable Graphiti community detection (fix graphiti-core 0.22.0 bug)
- Auto-generate community summaries (GraphRAG approach)
- Integrate community-based routing into query router
- Support hierarchical community clustering

**2. Query Explanation** (`apex_memory.query_router.query_explainer`)

- LLM-generated result explanations ("Why these results?")
- Confidence intervals for each result
- Alternative query suggestions
- Claude-powered natural language explanations

**3. Temporal Analytics** (`apex_memory.query_router.temporal_analytics`)

- Pattern prediction (predict future trends from historical data)
- Anomaly detection (identify outliers in temporal data)
- Time-series forecasting (predict equipment failures, utilization trends)

**4. Graph Analytics** (`apex_memory.query_router.graph_analytics`)

- Centrality metrics (PageRank, betweenness centrality)
- Shortest path queries (find relationship paths between entities)
- Subgraph extraction (extract relevant entity clusters)
- Entity canonicalization (deduplicate entities across sources)

## Feature Flag Strategy

### Safe Defaults

**Default:** All new features disabled (safe rollout)

```python
# router.py
enable_community_detection=False  # Feature flag
enable_query_explanation=False    # Feature flag
enable_temporal_analytics=False   # Feature flag
enable_graph_analytics=False      # Feature flag
```

**Opt-In:** Enable features individually

```python
# Enable community detection only
enable_community_detection=True

# Enable all features
enable_community_detection=True
enable_query_explanation=True
enable_temporal_analytics=True
enable_graph_analytics=True
```

### Testing Strategy

**Phase 1: Feature Flags Off (Baseline Preservation)**

```bash
# All features disabled
cd apex-memory-system
pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/load/ -v

# Expected: All 223 existing tests pass (no regression)
```

**Phase 2: Feature Flags On (New Feature Validation)**

```bash
# Enable all features
# Update test configuration to enable features

pytest upgrades/active/query-router-enhancements/tests/ -v

# Expected: 40+ new tests pass
```

**Phase 3: Deployment**

```bash
# After validation passes, enable in production
# Update router initialization to enable features

# Monitor performance
# Community queries: <2s
# Query explanations: <500ms
```

---

## Dependencies

## Deployment Checklist

**Before Deployment:**

- [ ] All 4 weeks of implementation complete
- [ ] CommunityManager class created and tested
- [ ] QueryExplainer class created and tested
- [ ] TemporalAnalytics class created and tested
- [ ] GraphAnalytics class created and tested
- [ ] Feature flags tested (on/off)
- [ ] 40+ new tests passing
- [ ] Existing 223 tests still passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (community queries <2s, explanations <500ms)
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

**After Deployment:**

- [ ] Enable community detection in production (feature flag)
- [ ] Monitor Grafana metrics for community queries
- [ ] Query Neo4j to verify communities exist
- [ ] Review first 100 queries for explanation quality
- [ ] Track user satisfaction with explanations
- [ ] Document any issues in GitHub

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate (Post-Implementation)

1. **100% Graphiti Utilization** (vs. 70% current)
2. **Community Detection** (auto-clustering of related entities)
3. **Query Explanations** (90%+ user satisfaction)
4. **Temporal Analytics** (pattern prediction, anomaly detection)
5. **Graph Analytics** (centrality, shortest paths)

### Medium-Term (1-2 weeks post-deployment)

1. **Better Search Results** (community-based routing improves relevance)
2. **Improved User Experience** (explanations build trust)
3. **Advanced Analytics** (patterns and anomalies detected automatically)

### Long-Term (1+ months post-deployment)

1. **Competitive Advantage** (100% Graphiti utilization vs competitors)
2. **Community Insights** (auto-generated summaries of entity clusters)
3. **Predictive Analytics** (forecast trends, equipment failures)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Community Detection Bug Persists

**Mitigation:**
- Test graphiti-core 0.23.0+ first
- If bug persists, implement custom community detection using NetworkX
- Document workaround in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Risk 2: Query Explanation Accuracy Low

**Mitigation:**
- Start with simple template-based explanations
- Iterate on Claude prompt based on user feedback
- Add confidence intervals to flag low-quality explanations

### Risk 3: Performance Impact

**Mitigation:**
- Feature flags allow gradual rollout
- Cache community summaries (1 hour TTL)
- Async execution for all new features
- Monitor P90/P99 latency closely

### Risk 4: Implementation Takes Longer Than 4 Weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Detailed week-by-week implementation guide
- Clear success criteria for each week
- Can deploy partial (Week 1+2 complete, Week 3+4 post-deployment)
