# Query Router Improvement Plan - Quick Reference

**Status:** ✅ Planning Complete → 🚀 Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High
**Timeline:** 8 weeks (4 phases)
**Last Updated:** October 2025

## TL;DR

Comprehensive upgrade bringing Apex query routing from current keyword-based approach to 2025 standards with semantic classification, adaptive learning, agentic reasoning, and GraphRAG hybrid search.

## Expected Gains

| Metric | Current | Target | Gain |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| **Routing Accuracy** | 70-75% | 85-92% | +15-20% |
| **Relevance Score** | 0.72 | 0.85-0.93 | +21-28 points |
| **Intent Classification** | 100ms (keyword) | 10ms (semantic) | 90ms faster |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | 75% (exact match) | 90%+ (semantic) | +15%+ |
| **Precision (Relationships)** | 70-75% | 99% | +24-29% |
| **P90 Latency** | 800ms | <500ms | -37.5% |

## Current Problems (10 Critical Flaws)

1. ❌ **Keyword-based intent classification** (63.64% misclassification rate)
2. ❌ **No query rewriting** (missing +21-28 point gains)
3. ❌ **Static database weights** (no adaptation)
4. ❌ **No GraphRAG hybrid search** (missing 99% precision)
5. ❌ **No agentic capabilities** (no self-correction, reflection)
6. ❌ **No complexity analysis** (same routing for all queries)
7. ❌ **No out-of-scope detection** (wasted resources)
8. ❌ **Exact-match-only caching** (75% vs 90%+ possible)
9. ❌ **No confidence scores** (can't assess quality)
10. ❌ **No learned adaptation** (fixed rules forever)

**Code:** Lines 692-850 in IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md

## Quick Wins (Immediate Implementation)

Can be implemented today without dependencies:

1. **Add Confidence Scores** (10 min)
   - Add confidence threshold to intent classification
   - Return confidence with results

2. **Comprehensive Logging** (20 min)
   - Log all routing decisions
   - Track query types and latencies

3. **Out-of-Scope Detection** (30 min)
   - Detect irrelevant queries
   - Return early with helpful message

4. **Query Normalization** (15 min)
   - Grammar correction
   - Spelling fixes
   - Standardization

5. **Timing Metrics** (15 min)
   - Track per-database latencies
   - Identify bottlenecks

**Total Time:** ~90 minutes
**Impact:** Better observability, immediate quality improvements

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Semantic Router latency | Benchmark first, fallback to keywords if >50ms |
| Neo4j vector performance | A/B test, keep Qdrant as primary |
| Adaptive weights instability | Gradual updates, min/max bounds |
| Query rewriting quality | Validation loop, user feedback |
