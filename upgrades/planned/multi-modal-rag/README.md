## Problem Statement

The Apex Memory System currently supports text-only retrieval. This limits applicability for use cases involving images, structured data (tables), and audio/video content.

### Current Limitations

1. **Image Blindness:**
   - Images in documents ignored during ingestion
   - Cannot search by visual content
   - Charts/diagrams lost
   - Screenshots not processable

2. **Table Structure Loss:**
   - Tables extracted as plain text
   - Semantic structure flattened
   - Complex queries on table data impossible
   - CSV/Excel files treated as text

3. **No Audio/Video Support:**
   - Audio files cannot be ingested
   - Video content not transcribed
   - Temporal audio events not searchable
   - Podcasts, lectures, interviews excluded

4. **Single-Modal Embeddings:**
   - Text embeddings only (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`)
   - Cannot embed images
   - Cross-modal retrieval unavailable (text query ‚Üí image results)
   - Multi-modal reasoning not supported

## Goals

### Primary Goals

- ‚úÖ **Image ingestion and retrieval** - Search images by content
- ‚úÖ **Table structure preservation** - Query structured data semantically
- ‚úÖ **Audio/video transcription** - Searchable multimedia content
- ‚úÖ **Cross-modal retrieval** - Text query returns relevant images

### Secondary Goals

- Multi-modal embeddings (unified embedding space)
- Image captioning and annotation
- OCR for text-in-images
- Video scene understanding
- Audio event detection

## Research Needed

### Multi-Modal Embedding Models

**To Research:**
- CLIP (OpenAI) - Image and text embeddings
- ImageBind (Meta) - Unified multi-modal space (image, text, audio, video)
- GPT-5 vision capabilities (Oct 2025)
- Gemini multi-modal embeddings
- Open-source alternatives (BLIP, ALIGN)

**Questions:**
- Same embedding dimension as text (1536)?
- Can we store in same Qdrant collection?
- Performance vs text-only embeddings?
- API costs and latency?

### Table Structure Preservation

**To Research:**
- Table extraction libraries (Camelot, Tabula, pdfplumber)
- Semantic table understanding
- Table-to-text generation
- Graph-based table representation

**Questions:**
- Store tables as structured data or embeddings?
- How to enable complex table queries?
- Integration with PostgreSQL vs separate store?
- How to preserve relationships between cells?

### Audio/Video Transcription

**To Research:**
- Whisper (OpenAI) - Speech-to-text
- AssemblyAI - Enhanced transcription
- Deepgram - Real-time transcription
- Speaker diarization services

**Questions:**
- Real-time vs batch transcription?
- How to handle multiple speakers?
- Timestamp alignment with visual content?
- Cost per hour of audio/video?

### Multi-Modal RAG Frameworks

**To Research:**
- LlamaIndex multi-modal support
- LangChain multi-modal retrievers
- Haystack image search
- Weaviate multi-modal collections
- Qdrant multi-vector search

**Questions:**
- Best practices for multi-modal retrieval?
- How to rank cross-modal results?
- Fusion strategies (text + image results)?
- Production deployments to learn from?

- Higher cost implications (API usage)
- Other upgrades provide more immediate value

**Could Elevate to Medium/High If:**
- User demand for image/audio search emerges
- Competitive differentiation needed
- Use cases expand beyond text documents
- Multi-modal models become more cost-effective
