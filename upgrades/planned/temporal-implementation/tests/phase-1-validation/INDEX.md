# Phase 1: Pre-Testing Validation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours

## Overview

Phase 1 focused on validating deployment infrastructure and health checks before beginning integration testing. The validate-deployment.py script was executed and 5 critical issues were identified and fixed.

## Contents

- **PHASE-1-VALIDATION-FIXES.md** - Complete documentation of 5 critical fixes applied to validation script
- **PHASE-1-CHECKLIST.md** - Pre-flight checklist for validation procedures

## Key Achievements

✅ Fixed 5 critical issues in validation script:
1. Temporal SDK API changes (execute_workflow args=[])
2. Redis authentication handling
3. Qdrant gRPC/TLS configuration
4. PostgreSQL connection pool access
5. Environment variable loading

✅ All infrastructure validated:
- Temporal Server (localhost:7233)
- Neo4j (localhost:7687)
- PostgreSQL (localhost:5432)
- Qdrant (localhost:6333)
- Redis (localhost:6379)

✅ All health checks passing:
- Worker registration validated
- Database connectivity confirmed
- Activity/workflow registration verified

## Production Impact

**CRITICAL:** Identified production code issues that would have caused failures in production:
- Temporal SDK API incompatibility (5 locations in workflow)
- Qdrant TLS configuration for local development
- Redis password handling for no-auth scenarios

## Next Phase

Phase 2A: Execute Integration Tests with fix-and-document workflow
