# Temporal Intelligence Enhancement

**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** üìù Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD
**Research Progress:** 0%

## Problem Statement

The Graphiti temporal intelligence layer is integrated but underutilized. We're not leveraging its full capabilities for pattern detection, time-series analysis, and temporal reasoning.

### Current Issues

1. **Pattern Detection Missing:**
   - No recurring theme identification
   - Trend analysis not implemented
   - Temporal anomaly detection absent
   - Historical pattern matching unavailable

2. **Limited Query Router Integration:**
   - Temporal queries not routed optimally
   - No time-aware query classification
   - Historical context underutilized
   - Point-in-time retrieval not exposed

3. **Community Detection Unused:**
   - Graphiti supports community detection (Leiden algorithm)
   - Microsoft GraphRAG shows 10x token reduction benefit
   - We haven't implemented hierarchical summaries
   - Global queries miss "big picture" reasoning

4. **Time-Series Capabilities Missing:**
   - No forecasting or prediction
   - Trend projection unavailable
   - Temporal correlation analysis absent
   - Change velocity tracking missing

## Priority Rationale

**Why Medium Priority:**
- Temporal layer exists but underutilized (not broken)
- Query Router upgrade takes precedence
- Enhancement vs critical fix
- Unlocks advanced capabilities

**Could Elevate to High If:**
- User demand for temporal queries increases
- Pattern detection becomes competitive differentiator
- Community detection shows major performance gains
- Time-series insights prove high-value
