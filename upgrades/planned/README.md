```

### Planned Phase Criteria

An upgrade is in `planned/` when:
- ✅ Problem or opportunity identified
- ✅ High-level goals defined
- ✅ Priority assigned
- ❌ Comprehensive research NOT yet complete
- ❌ Detailed implementation plan NOT yet created
- ❌ Review Board approval NOT yet obtained

### Graduation to Active

An upgrade moves from `planned/` to active when:
1. ✅ Research phase completed (Tier 1-3 sources documented)
2. ✅ Comprehensive IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md created
3. ✅ Review Board (Phase 3.5) approves the plan
4. ✅ Implementation timeline established
5. ✅ Moved to `upgrades/[name]/` directory

## Planned Upgrades Details

### 1. Ingestion Pipeline v2

**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD

**Problem:**
Current ingestion pipeline has limitations:
- Document parsing quality varies by format
- Limited multi-modal support (text-focused)
- Parallel processing could be more efficient
- Entity extraction quality inconsistent

**Goals:**
- Improve document parsing quality (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
- Add multi-modal support (images, tables, diagrams)
- Optimize parallel processing for 10+ docs/second
- Enhance entity extraction accuracy
- Add semantic chunking strategies

**Research Needed:**
- Document parsing libraries (Docling, Unstructured, etc.)
- Multi-modal embedding models
- Parallel processing patterns (saga pattern refinement)
- Entity extraction techniques (NER, LLM-based)

**Next Steps:**
1. Research document parsing solutions
2. Evaluate multi-modal embedding models
3. Benchmark current ingestion performance
4. Create detailed improvement plan

### 2. Temporal Intelligence Enhancement

**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD

**Problem:**
Temporal intelligence layer (Graphiti) underutilized:
- Pattern detection not yet implemented
- Time-series forecasting missing
- Limited integration with query router
- Community detection not leveraged

**Goals:**
- Implement pattern detection (recurring themes, trends)
- Add time-series forecasting capabilities
- Integrate temporal queries with router
- Leverage Graphiti community detection
- Add temporal summarization

**Research Needed:**
- Graphiti advanced features documentation
- Pattern detection algorithms
- Time-series forecasting libraries
- Temporal query patterns

**Next Steps:**
1. Deep-dive Graphiti documentation
2. Research pattern detection approaches
3. Evaluate time-series libraries
4. Design temporal query integration

### 3. Multi-Modal RAG

**Priority:** Low
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD

**Problem:**
Current RAG system is text-only:
- Cannot process images
- Tables extracted as text (loses structure)
- Audio/video content not supported
- Limited visualization retrieval

**Goals:**
- Support image ingestion and retrieval
- Preserve table structure in retrieval
- Add audio/video transcription and search
- Multi-modal embedding generation
- Cross-modal retrieval (text query → image results)

**Research Needed:**
- Multi-modal embedding models (CLIP, ImageBind)
- Table structure preservation techniques
- Audio/video transcription services
- Multi-modal RAG frameworks

**Next Steps:**
1. Research multi-modal embedding models
2. Evaluate table extraction libraries
3. Assess audio/video transcription options
4. Survey multi-modal RAG implementations

## Adding New Planned Upgrades

### 1. Identify Opportunity

- What problem does this solve?
- What value does it provide?
- Is it aligned with project goals?

### 2. Create Directory

```bash
mkdir upgrades/planned/[upgrade-name]
```

### 3. Create Initial README

```markdown
# [Upgrade Name]

**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD

## Problem Statement
[What problem are we solving?]

## Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Research Phase Workflow

### 1. Problem Validation
- Confirm problem exists and is significant
- Assess impact vs effort
- Verify alignment with project goals

### 2. Research Gathering
- Find Tier 1 sources (official documentation)

- Document Tier 3+ supporting materials
- Store in `research/documentation/[topic]/`

### 3. Solution Exploration
- Evaluate alternative approaches
- Identify proven patterns
- Document trade-offs
- Estimate complexity

### 4. Plan Creation
- Create comprehensive IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
- Define phased implementation
- Establish success metrics
- Identify risks and mitigation

### 5. Review Board Submission
- Submit to Phase 3.5 Review Board
- CIO: Validates research quality
- CTO: Validates technical approach
- COO: Validates execution feasibility

### 6. Graduation to Active
- Move from `planned/` to `upgrades/[name]/`
- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Track progress with TodoWrite
