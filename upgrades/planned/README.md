## Planned Upgrades Details

### 1. Security Layer Implementation

**Priority:** High (Must-Have Before Production)
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** 4 weeks (2 phases)
**Research Progress:** 0%

**Problem Statement:**

The Apex Memory System has ZERO security implementation:
- ❌ No authentication (anyone can access API)
- ❌ No authorization (no user permissions/roles)
- ❌ No rate limiting (vulnerable to abuse/DoS)
- ❌ No encryption (data in plaintext)
- ❌ No audit logging (no tracking)
- ❌ No multi-tenancy (cannot isolate data)

**Goals:**

**Phase 1: Core Security (Must-Have):**
- OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens
- Redis-based rate limiting (per-user, per-IP)
- TLS/HTTPS encryption
- Audit logging to PostgreSQL

**Phase 2: Advanced Security (Nice-to-Have):**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- API key management

**Expected Gains:**
- ✅ Complete authentication and authorization
- ✅ DoS protection (100 req/hour/IP rate limit)
- ✅ HTTPS encryption (TLS 1.3)
- ✅ Audit logging (all requests tracked)
- ✅ 80% compliance readiness (SOC 2, GDPR basics)

**Research Needed:**
- OAuth2/OIDC providers (Auth0 vs Keycloak)
- FastAPI security patterns
- Redis rate limiting algorithms
- Encryption key management

**Next Steps:**
1. Compare Auth0 vs Keycloak (cost, features, self-hosted)
2. Design authentication middleware
3. Define rate limit thresholds
4. Create comprehensive security plan

### 2. Temporal Workflow Orchestration

**Priority:** High (Ready for Implementation)
**Status:** 📝 Planning Complete → 🚀 Ready for POC
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (4 phases)
**Research Progress:** 40% (architecture analysis complete)

**Problem Statement:**

Current saga-based orchestration has limitations:
- ❌ No visibility into workflow execution state
- ❌ Manual compensation logic for each operation
- ❌ No automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ❌ Limited distributed tracing
- ❌ Cannot pause/resume long-running workflows

**Goals:**

Replace custom saga pattern with Temporal.io workflow orchestration:
- Durable workflows with automatic state management
- Built-in retry, timeout, and compensation (saga pattern)
- Distributed tracing and complete observability
- Workflow versioning and migration support

**Expected Gains:**
- ✅ 99.9% workflow reliability (Temporal SLA)
- ✅ Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ Complete workflow visibility in Temporal UI
- ✅ Pause/resume/cancel long-running operations
- ✅ Zero custom compensation logic (built-in)

**Research Foundation:**
- [Temporal.io Python SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python) - Official documentation
- [Temporal Architecture](https://docs.temporal.io/concepts) - Core concepts
- [ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS-2025.md](../../ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS-2025.md) - Analysis of workflow orchestration benefits

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Infrastructure setup (Temporal server, Python SDK, workers)
2. **Week 3-4:** Ingestion workflow migration (with gradual rollout 10% → 100%)
3. **Week 5-6:** Query workflow migration (including long-running query support)
4. **Week 7-8:** Monitoring, observability, and Prometheus metrics export

**Key Features:**
- Durable execution (state persisted to database, survives crashes)
- Automatic compensation (built-in saga pattern rollback)
- Workflow history and replay (deterministic debugging)
- Multi-datacenter replication support

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy Temporal server locally (Docker Compose)
2. Implement single document ingestion workflow (POC)
3. Validate retry and compensation behavior
4. Plan gradual traffic migration strategy

### 3. API Connections & External Integrations

**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** 📝 Planning Phase (FrontApp specification complete)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (4 phases)
**Research Progress:** 20%

**Problem Statement:**

Current system is standalone with no external integrations:
- ❌ No FrontApp conversation history ingestion
- ❌ No CRM contact/account sync
- ❌ No analytics platform integration
- ❌ Manual data entry required
- ❌ No real-time updates from external systems

**Goals:**

Build robust API integration layer to connect with external platforms:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with external platforms
- Webhook receivers for real-time updates
- Scheduled sync jobs for batch imports
- Bi-directional data synchronization
- Rate limiting and retry logic

**Key Integrations:**

**Priority 1: FrontApp**

- Contact metadata extraction
- Expected volume: ~1000 conversations/day, ~5000 messages/day

**Priority 2: CRM Systems (Salesforce/HubSpot)**
- Account/contact sync
- Deal pipeline tracking
- Activity history
- Custom field mapping

**Priority 3: Analytics Platforms (Google Analytics/Mixpanel)**
- Event stream ingestion
- User session data
- Conversion funnel metrics
- Cohort analysis data

**Expected Gains:**
- ✅ Automatic ingestion from 5+ external platforms
- ✅ Real-time updates via webhooks (<30 second latency)
- ✅ 99.9% sync reliability
- ✅ Zero manual data entry
- ✅ Complete conversation context for support queries

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Integration framework (OAuth2 layer, webhook infrastructure, sync scheduler)
2. **Week 3-4:** FrontApp integration (OAuth connection, conversation sync, webhook handler)
3. **Week 5-6:** CRM integration (Salesforce/HubSpot sync, data mapping)
4. **Week 7-8:** Monitoring and admin interface (dashboard, sync logs, retry management)

**Research Foundation:**
- [FrontApp API Documentation](https://dev.frontapp.com/) - Complete API reference
- [OAuth 2.0 Best Practices](https://oauth.net/2/) - Authentication standards
- [Webhook Security](https://webhook.site/docs) - Signature validation patterns

**FrontApp Specification:**
- Complete OAuth 2.0 flow implementation
- Webhook handler with HMAC signature validation
- Sync manager with pagination and rate limiting (5 req/sec)
- Entity extraction and sentiment analysis
- Real-time conversation updates

**Next Steps:**
1. Review FrontApp API documentation in detail
2. Design OAuth authentication flow
3. Prototype webhook receiver and signature validation
4. Implement POC for single conversation sync
