### 4. Production Deployment

**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD (defer until 100x scale needed)

**Problem:**
Current deployment strategy not optimized for production:
- Manual scaling processes
- No Kubernetes auto-scaling
- Basic monitoring only
- Limited deployment automation

**Goals:**
- Kubernetes auto-scaling for services
- Horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) based on metrics
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Production-grade monitoring and alerting
- Blue-green deployment strategy

**Research Needed:**
- Kubernetes auto-scaling patterns
- HPA best practices
- ArgoCD/Flux for GitOps
- Production monitoring stacks

**Deferred Rationale:**
- Current traffic: ~100 queries/day
- Auto-scaling needed at: 10,000+ queries/day (100x growth)
- Manual scaling sufficient for now
- Focus on features before scaling infrastructure

**Next Steps:**
1. Research Kubernetes HPA configurations
2. Evaluate GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux)
3. Design deployment pipeline
4. Create production deployment plan

📂 **Planning:** Deferred until scale justifies complexity

---

### 5. Scaling Infrastructure

**Priority:** Low
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD (defer until bottleneck observed)

**Problem:**
Potential future scaling bottlenecks:
- Neo4j may need sharding at enterprise scale
- Single-instance databases limit throughput
- No read replicas configured

**Goals:**
- Neo4j Fabric sharding for multi-database queries
- PostgreSQL read replicas
- Qdrant horizontal scaling
- Load balancing across instances

**Research Needed:**
- Neo4j Fabric architecture and costs
- PostgreSQL replication strategies
- Qdrant clustering setup
- Database load balancing

**Deferred Rationale:**
- Current load: Well below single-instance limits
- Neo4j Fabric: 8x cost increase ($4,000/month)
- No observed bottlenecks yet
- Premature optimization

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Neo4j Fabric: $48,000/year vs current $6,000/year
- Benefit: Handles 100M+ nodes (currently <10K)
- Verdict: Wait until 10M+ nodes

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor database performance metrics
2. Set scaling triggers (e.g., >80% CPU sustained)
3. Research Fabric setup when needed
4. Plan migration strategy

📂 **Planning:** Monitor-and-defer until bottleneck observed

### 6. Production Hardening

**Priority:** Low
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD (defer until post-stable)

**Problem:**
System resilience not yet tested at scale:
- No chaos engineering practices
- Failure modes not fully explored
- Recovery procedures untested
- Limited fault injection

**Goals:**
- Implement chaos engineering (Chaos Mesh)
- Automated failure injection testing
- Documented recovery procedures
- Resilience score tracking
- Game day exercises

**Research Needed:**
- Chaos Mesh setup and patterns
- Failure injection strategies
- Recovery automation
- Resilience benchmarking

**Deferred Rationale:**
- Need stable baseline first
- Saga pattern enhancement provides core resilience
- Chaos engineering premature for pre-launch system
- Focus on building features before breaking them

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete saga pattern enhancement
2. Achieve 99.9% consistency baseline
3. Research Chaos Mesh integration
4. Design failure scenarios
5. Create chaos engineering roadmap

📂 **Planning:** Defer until stable system baseline achieved

### 7. Cost Optimization

**Priority:** Low
**Status:** 📝 Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD (defer until post-revenue)

**Problem:**
Current system prioritizes quality over cost:
- GPT-4 for entity extraction ($1,000/month at scale)
- Premium embedding models
- No cost monitoring per query

**Goals:**
- Evaluate local models for entity extraction
- Hybrid local/cloud strategy
- Per-query cost tracking
- Cost optimization without quality loss

**Research Needed:**
- Local NER models (spaCy, Flair, custom)
- Quality benchmarks (local vs GPT-4)
- Cost tracking instrumentation
- Hybrid orchestration patterns

**Deferred Rationale:**
- Pre-revenue phase: quality > cost
- Local models: 15% accuracy drop (92% → 78%)
- Savings: $1,000/month (~$12K/year)
- Quality loss unacceptable for core feature

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Annual savings: $12,000
- Migration cost: $8,000 (engineering time)
- Quality cost: 15% accuracy reduction
- Verdict: Not worth trade-off until revenue justifies

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Fine-tune GPT-3.5 (cheaper, minimal quality loss)
- Use local models for non-critical paths only
- Implement caching for repeated entity extractions

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor costs as system scales
2. Benchmark fine-tuned GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
3. Identify non-critical paths for local models
4. Create hybrid strategy if needed

📂 **Planning:** Defer until revenue or 10x cost increase
