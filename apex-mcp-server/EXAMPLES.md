## Searching Memories

### Basic Search

```
You: "What do you know about ACME Corporation?"

Claude: [Searches knowledge graph]

        I found 7 results about ACME Corporation:

        1. ACME Corp ordered 50 brake parts from Bosch (Jan 15)
        2. ACME Invoice INV-001 payment status updated to paid
        3. ACME Corp is in the Manufacturing community
        ...
```

### Semantic Search

```
You: "What companies have I worked with on brake systems?"

Claude: [Semantic search across entities]

        Based on your knowledge graph:

        1. ACME Corporation - Primary customer, 12 documents
        2. Bosch - Supplier for brake parts
        3. Brembo - Secondary supplier (added March 2025)

        All three are connected through brake systems relationships.

## The Power of ask_apex()

### Comprehensive Entity Exploration

```
You: "Tell me everything you know about ACME Corporation"

Claude: [Orchestrates 6 queries: search + graph + temporal + patterns + communities + analytics]

        I've analyzed ACME Corporation across your entire knowledge graph. Here's what I found:

        üìä Overview
        ACME Corporation is one of your most important entities with:
        - 12 associated documents
        - 8 connected entities
        - 3 months of tracked history
        - Member of 2 communities (Manufacturing, Suppliers)

        üîó Key Relationships
        Primary supplier: Bosch (83% of orders)
        - 7 orders placed, totaling 350 brake parts
        - Relationship established: December 2024

        Secondary supplier: Brembo (17% of orders)
        - Recently added: March 2025
        - 2 orders placed, totaling 100 parts

        üìà Patterns Detected
        ‚ú® Recurring ordering pattern: Every 3-4 weeks (89% consistency)
        ‚ú® Typical order size: 50-75 brake parts
        ‚ú® Recent supplier diversification suggests strategic risk management

        üìç Timeline

        üí° Insights
        ACME is a stable, predictable customer. Their recent supplier change
        from Bosch-only to Bosch+Brembo indicates strategic risk mitigation.
        They're highly connected (8 relationships) making them a hub entity
        in your supply chain knowledge graph.

        Would you like me to investigate:
        - Why did ACME switch suppliers in March?
        - Compare ACME's ordering patterns to other customers
        - Show me ACME's complete supplier history
```

### Temporal Analysis

```

### Relationship Exploration

```
You: "How are ACME and Bosch connected?"

Claude: [Orchestrates: search both + find path + temporal context]

        ACME and Bosch connection analysis:

        üîó Direct Connections (3 paths found)
        1. ACME ‚Üí ORDERED_FROM ‚Üí Bosch (Primary)
           - Strength: 7 orders
           - First: Jan 15, 2025
           - Last: Feb 28, 2025

        2. ACME ‚Üí USES_PARTS_FROM ‚Üí Bosch
           - Brake pads, brake rotors
           - Quality rating: High

        3. Via You (shared context):
           - You ‚Üí WORKS_WITH ‚Üí ACME
           - You ‚Üí EVALUATES ‚Üí Bosch

        üìà Evolution Over Time
        Dec 2024: No connection
        Jan 2025: First order established
        Feb 2025: Relationship strengthened (5 more orders)
        Mar 2025: ACME added Brembo, Bosch share decreased to 83%

        üí° Insights
        Bosch has been ACME's primary supplier for brake systems for 3 months.
        Recent addition of Brembo suggests ACME is reducing supplier risk,
        but Bosch remains dominant with 83% share.

        Follow-up questions:
        - Why did ACME add Brembo as a supplier?
        - What other customers use Bosch?
        - Compare Bosch and Brembo pricing/quality

## Multi-Turn Conversations

```
You: "Remember my conversation with the sales team:
     Me: What's our Q1 revenue target?
     Sales: $500K, focusing on brake systems

     Sales: ACME and Beta Inc"

Claude: ‚úÖ Conversation stored!

You: "What was the Q1 target?"

Claude: Based on your conversation with the sales team:
        Q1 revenue target: $500K
        Focus area: Brake systems
        Priority customers: ACME Corp, Beta Inc

You: "Are we on track?"

Claude: Let me check the current status against your Q1 target...

        [Searches orders, calculates totals]

        Current Status (as of March 5):
        - Total revenue: $325K (65% of $500K target)
        - From brake systems: $310K (95% of revenue)
        - From priority customers: $280K (86% of revenue)

        You're tracking well! 2 months remaining to reach $500K.
        Current run rate suggests you'll hit $487K by end of Q1.

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with ask_apex()

**Good:**
```
"Tell me everything you know about ACME Corporation's supplier relationships"
```

**Better:**
```
"Analyze ACME Corporation's supplier relationships over the last 3 months.
 Include ordering patterns, supplier changes, and any detected trends."
```

### 2. Use Temporal Context

**Instead of:**
```
"What changed?"
```

**Try:**
```
"What changed in my knowledge graph this week?"
"How did ACME evolve from January to March?"
"What was the supplier situation in February?"
```

### 3. Leverage Communities

```
You: "What are my main knowledge clusters?"

Claude: [Gets communities]

        You have 23 knowledge communities:

        Top 5:
        1. Work (48 entities) - ACME, Projects, Suppliers
        2. Programming (37 entities) - Python, JavaScript, Tools
        3. Personal (25 entities) - Hobbies, Travel, Family
        ...

You: "Tell me about my Work community"

Claude: [Deep dive into Work community context]
```

### 4. Ask for Comparisons

```
"Compare ACME and Beta Inc as customers"
"Which supplier has better order consistency - Bosch or Brembo?"
"How does my Q1 performance compare to Q4?"
```
