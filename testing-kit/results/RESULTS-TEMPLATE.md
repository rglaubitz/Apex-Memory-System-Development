## Deployment Decision

### Critical Criteria Checklist

**ALL must be checked for GO:**

- [ ] ✅ Enhanced Saga: 121/121 tests passing
- [ ] ✅ All databases: Healthy and connectable
- [ ] ✅ Workflows: Both E2E workflows succeeding
- [ ] ✅ API: All endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] ✅ Metrics: Recording in Prometheus
- [ ] ✅ Zero critical errors in logs

### Optional Criteria

- [ ] ⚠️ Load testing: 10+ docs/sec achieved
- [ ] ⚠️ Cache hit rate: >60%
- [ ] ⚠️ Query latency: <1s P90
- [ ] ⚠️ Chaos testing: Graceful degradation validated

---

## Final Decision

**Decision:** ✅ GO / ❌ NO-GO / ⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO

**Confidence Level:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**Risk Assessment:** LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH

### Justification

```
[Explain the decision based on test results]

Example:
"GO - All critical criteria met. Enhanced Saga 121/121, all workflows E2E success,
metrics recording correctly. Optional load testing shows 12 docs/sec (above target).
Cache hit rate 68% (above 60% target). Zero critical errors.
Confidence: HIGH, Risk: LOW."

OR

"NO-GO - Enhanced Saga only 118/121 passing. 3 tests failing in distributed locking
module. This is a data integrity risk. Must fix before deployment.
Confidence: LOW, Risk: HIGH."
```

### Blockers (If NO-GO)

1. **[Blocker 1]**
   - **Issue:** [Description]
   - **Impact:** [Why this blocks deployment]
   - **Fix Required:** [What needs to be done]

2. **[Blocker 2]**
   - ...

### Deployment Recommendation

**Recommendation:** PROCEED / FIX ISSUES FIRST / DEPLOY WITH MONITORING

**Next Steps:**
```
[What should happen next based on decision]

Examples:
- "Proceed to production deployment. Monitor Grafana closely for first 24 hours."
- "Fix 3 failing distributed locking tests, re-run Enhanced Saga baseline."
- "Deploy to staging first, run 7-day load test before production."
```
