## Overview

The **Verifications for Deployment** system ensures that every architectural question, missing feature hypothesis, and deployment concern is systematically researched and resolved before production deployment.

### Key Principles

1. **Theory-Driven:** Start with a hypothesis about what might be missing
2. **Evidence-Based:** Research the codebase to gather evidence
3. **Automated:** Verified results automatically trigger next steps
4. **Traceable:** Complete audit trail from theory → verification → implementation

---

## Why This System Exists

During pre-deployment review, critical questions emerged:

- "How does the LLM connect to the memory system?"
- "Are the data pipelines fully implemented?"
- "What parts of the system are actually turned on?"
- "Is the UI ready for production?"

Rather than assumptions, we need **systematic verification** of every architectural component before deployment.

## Workflow Automation

### Complete Flow

```
1. UNVERIFIED THEORY CREATED
   └─ File: unverified/[theory-name].md
   └─ Contains: Hypothesis, Expected Behavior, Why Important, Research Plan

2. RESEARCH CONDUCTED
   └─ Search codebase for evidence
   └─ Run relevant tests
   └─ Document findings in research-logs/
   └─ Gather proof (code snippets, test results)

3. VERIFICATION DECISION
   └─ Is the feature implemented?
      ├─ YES → Go to Step 4A
      └─ NO  → Go to Step 4B

4A. FEATURE IS IMPLEMENTED
    └─ Move theory to: verified/implemented/[theory-name].md
    └─ Update file with:
       - How it works (architecture explanation)
       - Code locations (file paths)
       - Examples (code snippets)
       - How to use it
    └─ Mark as deployment-ready

4B. FEATURE IS MISSING
    └─ Move theory to: verified/missing/[theory-name].md
    └─ Update file with:
       - What's missing (specific gaps)
       - Why critical (deployment impact)
       - Evidence (research findings)
    └─ AUTO-TRIGGER: Create upgrades/active/[feature-name]/
       - IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
       - IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
       - Research foundation
    └─ Begin implementation

5. IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (for missing features)
   └─ Feature implemented and tested
   └─ Move from verified/missing/ to verified/implemented/
   └─ Update with final architecture
   └─ Mark as deployment-ready
```

### Automation Rules

**Rule 1: Auto-Trigger Upgrade Creation**

When a theory is verified as **MISSING**, the system automatically creates:

```
upgrades/active/[feature-name]/
├── IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md       (what needs to be built)
├── IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md   (how to build it)
├── research/                 (research foundation)
└── tests/                    (test specifications)
```

**Rule 2: Auto-Move on Implementation**

When a feature moves from `verified/missing/` to implemented:

1. Update `verified/missing/[feature].md` → `verified/implemented/[feature].md`
2. Mark as deployment-ready
3. Archive upgrade folder to `upgrades/completed/`

**Rule 3: Deployment Readiness**

Deployment is **BLOCKED** if:
- Any theories remain in `unverified/` (not researched)
- Any critical features remain in `verified/missing/` (not implemented)
- Any 🔴 CRITICAL issues exist in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` (unresolved bugs)

Deployment is **GO** if:
- All theories verified
- All critical features in `verified/implemented/`
- All blockers resolved
- All CRITICAL issues in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` resolved or downgraded

---

## Known Issues Tracking

### Purpose

During verification and testing, bugs and issues are discovered that must be resolved before production deployment. The `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` file tracks all discovered issues with evidence, investigation plans, and resolution status.

### Issue Severity Levels

- **🔴 CRITICAL** - Blocks deployment, must be fixed
  - Complete feature failure
  - Data loss or corruption risk
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Core value proposition broken

- **🟡 HIGH** - Should be fixed before deployment, has workarounds
  - Degraded user experience
  - Performance issues
  - Non-critical features broken
  - Workarounds exist but suboptimal

- **🟢 LOW** - Can be deferred to post-deployment, minimal impact
  - Minor UI glitches
  - Edge cases
  - Nice-to-have features
  - Minimal user impact

### When to Create an Issue

**Create an issue in KNOWN-ISSUES.md when:**

1. **During Verification Research**
   - Feature exists but has critical bugs
   - Feature exists but doesn't work as expected
   - Integration failures discovered during testing

2. **During Implementation**
   - Bugs discovered while building new features
   - Regression bugs introduced by changes
   - Integration issues with existing systems

3. **During Testing**
   - Test failures reveal underlying bugs
   - Performance issues discovered under load
   - Edge cases cause failures

**Do NOT create an issue for:**
- Missing features (use `verified/missing/` instead)
- Feature requests (use `upgrades/planned/` instead)
- Research theories (use `unverified/` instead)

### Issue Documentation Requirements

Every issue in KNOWN-ISSUES.md must include:

1. **Description** - Clear explanation of the problem
2. **User Impact** - How this affects users (with ❌ bullet points)
3. **Evidence Gathered** - Database checks, logs, test results
4. **Fixes Already Applied** - What's been tried (with ✅/❌ status)
5. **Root Cause Hypothesis** - Likely causes with evidence
6. **Investigation Steps** - Systematic debugging plan with time estimates
7. **Workaround** - Temporary solution (if available)
8. **Priority Justification** - Why this severity level

### Issue Resolution Workflow

```
1. ISSUE DISCOVERED
   └─ Add to KNOWN-ISSUES.md with CRITICAL/HIGH/LOW severity
   └─ Document evidence and investigation plan

2. INVESTIGATION
   └─ Follow investigation steps documented in issue
   └─ Update issue with findings
   └─ Document attempted fixes (successful or failed)

3. RESOLUTION
   └─ Fix is implemented and tested
   └─ Move issue from severity section to "Resolved Issues"
   └─ Document resolution method and verification

4. VERIFICATION
   └─ Confirm fix works in production-like environment
   └─ Update deployment readiness status
```

### Deployment Impact

**CRITICAL issues block deployment:**
- Deployment cannot proceed until resolved
- Must be fixed or downgraded to HIGH/LOW
- Requires full investigation and resolution

**HIGH issues should be resolved:**
- Deployment can proceed with documented workarounds
- Should be fixed before production if possible
- Post-deployment fix acceptable if risk is low

**LOW issues can be deferred:**
- Deployment proceeds without blocking
- Can be fixed post-deployment
- Tracked for future sprints

### Current Status

Check `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` for:
- Open CRITICAL issues (deployment blockers)
- Open HIGH issues (should fix before deployment)
- Open LOW issues (can defer)
- Resolved issues (for historical reference)

**Deployment Readiness Check:**
```bash
# Count CRITICAL issues
grep -c "🔴 ISSUE-" deployment/verification/KNOWN-ISSUES.md

# If count > 0, deployment is BLOCKED
```

## Creating Unverified Theories

### Theory Template

Every unverified theory file must contain:

```markdown
# [Theory Name]

**Status:** UNVERIFIED
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Researcher:** [Name]
**Priority:** [Blocker | Critical | Important | Nice-to-have]

---

## Hypothesis

[Clear statement of what you believe is missing or incomplete]

**Example:**
"The Apex Memory System lacks an LLM conversation integration architecture. There is no mechanism to capture LLM conversations, extract entities, and store them in the multi-database system."

---

## Expected Behavior

**Where it should exist:**
- File locations where this feature should be implemented
- API endpoints that should exist
- Workflows that should be defined

**How it should work:**
- User flow (step-by-step)
- System flow (API → Temporal → Databases)
- Expected outputs

**Example:**
"Expected: API endpoint /api/v1/conversation that accepts LLM conversations and triggers ConversationIngestionWorkflow."

---

## Why Important

**Deployment Impact:** [Blocker | Critical | Important | Nice-to-have]

**Blocker:** System cannot function without this feature
**Critical:** Major functionality impaired without this feature
**Important:** Feature adds significant value, but system can deploy without it
**Nice-to-have:** Enhancement that can be added post-deployment

**Explanation:**
[Why this feature is important for deployment readiness]

**Example:**
"BLOCKER: Without conversation capture, the LLM cannot build operational memory. This is the core value proposition of Apex Memory System."

---

## Research Plan

**Files to Check:**
- List specific files to search
- Pattern searches (e.g., "grep -r 'conversation' src/apex_memory/api/")

**Tests to Run:**
- Specific test files
- Integration tests
- API smoke tests

**Evidence Needed:**
- Code snippets
- Test results
- API responses
- Database queries

**Success Criteria:**
- What proves the feature is IMPLEMENTED?
- What proves the feature is MISSING?

## Verification Decision

### Decision Matrix

| Evidence | Finding | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| ✅ API endpoints exist<br>✅ Workflows defined<br>✅ Tests passing | **IMPLEMENTED** | Move to `verified/implemented/`<br>Document architecture |
| ❌ No API endpoints<br>❌ No workflows<br>❌ No tests | **MISSING** | Move to `verified/missing/`<br>Create upgrade plan |
| ⚠️ Partial implementation<br>⚠️ Some tests failing<br>⚠️ Incomplete features | **PARTIAL** | Move to `verified/missing/`<br>Document what's incomplete<br>Create completion plan |

### Making the Decision

**Feature is IMPLEMENTED if:**
1. API endpoints exist and respond correctly
2. Workflows are defined and execute successfully
3. Database writes are functional
4. Tests exist and pass
5. Documentation exists

**Feature is MISSING if:**
1. No API endpoints found
2. No workflows defined
3. No database tables/schemas
4. No tests exist
5. No documentation

**Feature is PARTIAL if:**
1. Some components exist but incomplete
2. Tests exist but failing
3. Documented but not implemented
4. Implemented but not tested

**Partial implementations are treated as MISSING** until fully complete.

---

## Auto-Trigger Rules

### Rule 1: Auto-Create Upgrade Plan (Missing Features)

When a theory is verified as **MISSING**:

**Automatic Actions:**
1. Move `unverified/[theory].md` → `verified/missing/[theory].md`
2. Create `upgrades/active/[feature-name]/` with:
   - `IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` (scope, timeline, deliverables)
   - `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` (step-by-step technical guide)
   - `research/` (research foundation)
   - `tests/` (test specifications)

**Trigger Command:**
```bash
# Automatic workflow (no manual command needed)
# System detects verified/missing/ file creation
# Auto-generates upgrade folder
```

### Rule 2: Auto-Move on Implementation

When a missing feature is implemented:

**Automatic Actions:**
1. Move `verified/missing/[feature].md` → `verified/implemented/[feature].md`
2. Update file with final architecture documentation
3. Archive `upgrades/active/[feature]/` → `upgrades/completed/[feature]/`
4. Mark as deployment-ready

**Trigger Criteria:**
- All upgrade tests passing
- Feature integrated into main system
- Documentation complete

### Rule 3: Deployment Readiness Check

**Pre-Deployment Validation:**

```bash
# Check for unverified theories
ls verifications-for-deployment/unverified/
# MUST BE EMPTY for deployment

# Check for missing critical features
ls verifications-for-deployment/verified/missing/
# MUST BE EMPTY (or only nice-to-have items) for deployment

# Check all features implemented
ls verifications-for-deployment/verified/implemented/
# MUST CONTAIN all critical features
```

**Deployment is GO if:**
- `unverified/` is empty
- `verified/missing/` has no blockers or critical items
- All critical features in `verified/implemented/`

**Deployment is NO-GO if:**
- Any theories remain unverified
- Any blocker/critical features in `verified/missing/`

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Unverified Theories

**Format:** `[phase]-[feature-name].md`

**Examples:**
- `phase-1-llm-conversation-integration.md`
- `phase-2-complete-data-pipeline.md`
- `database-schema-definitions.md`
- `query-router-implementation-status.md`

### Verified Files

**Format:** Same as unverified, maintains continuity

**Examples:**
- `verified/implemented/phase-1-llm-conversation-integration.md`
- `verified/missing/phase-3-structured-data-ingestion.md`

### Research Logs

**Format:** `[theory-name]-research.md`

**Examples:**
- `phase-1-llm-conversation-integration-research.md`
- `query-router-implementation-status-research.md`

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature is IMPLEMENTED

**Theory:** "Query Router Missing Implementation"

**Research:**
```bash
# Search for query router code
grep -r "QueryRouter" apex-memory-system/src/

# Found:
# - apex-memory-system/src/apex_memory/query_router/router.py
# - apex-memory-system/src/apex_memory/api/routes/query.py
# - Tests: tests/unit/test_query_router.py
```

**Decision:** **IMPLEMENTED**

**Action:**
1. Move `unverified/query-router-implementation.md` → `verified/implemented/query-router-implementation.md`
2. Update file with architecture:
   ```markdown
   # Query Router Implementation

   **Status:** IMPLEMENTED ✅

   ## Architecture

   The Query Router is fully implemented with intent classification and multi-database routing.

   **Code Locations:**
   - Router: `apex-memory-system/src/apex_memory/query_router/router.py`
   - API: `apex-memory-system/src/apex_memory/api/routes/query.py`
   - Tests: `tests/unit/test_query_router.py`

   **How It Works:**
   1. User submits query via /api/v1/query
   2. LLM classifies intent (graph, semantic, temporal, metadata)
   3. Router selects optimal database
   4. Results aggregated and returned

   **Example:**
   ```python
   POST /api/v1/query
   {"query": "Who supplies brake parts?"}

   Response: {
     "intent": "graph",
     "database": "neo4j",
     "results": [...]
   }
   ```
   ```

---

### Example 2: Feature is MISSING

**Theory:** "LLM Conversation Integration Architecture"

**Research:**
```bash
# Search for conversation endpoints
grep -r "conversation" apex-memory-system/src/apex_memory/api/
# NONE FOUND

# Search for conversation workflows
grep -r "ConversationIngestion" apex-memory-system/src/apex_memory/temporal/workflows/
# NONE FOUND

# Check for conversation tables
PGPASSWORD=apexmemory2024 psql -h localhost -U apex -d apex_memory -c "\dt" | grep conversation
# NONE FOUND
```

**Decision:** **MISSING**

**Action:**
1. Move `unverified/phase-1-llm-conversation-integration.md` → `verified/missing/phase-1-llm-conversation-integration.md`
2. Update file with findings:
   ```markdown
   # LLM Conversation Integration - MISSING

   **Status:** MISSING ❌
   **Priority:** BLOCKER

   ## What's Missing

   - No API endpoint for conversation capture
   - No ConversationIngestionWorkflow defined
   - No database schema for conversations
   - No tests for conversation ingestion

   ## Why Critical

   Without conversation capture, LLMs cannot build operational memory. This is the core value proposition.

   ## Evidence

   - API search: No /api/v1/conversation endpoint
   - Workflow search: No ConversationIngestionWorkflow
   - Database: No conversations table

   ## Next Steps

   AUTO-TRIGGERED: Created upgrades/active/llm-conversation-integration/
   ```

3. Auto-create upgrade folder:
   ```
   upgrades/active/llm-conversation-integration/
   ├── IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
   ├── IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
   ├── research/
   └── tests/
   ```
