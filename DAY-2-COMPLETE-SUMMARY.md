## 📊 Session 1: Worker Configuration & Ingestion Pipeline

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Critical Fixes (13 Total)

**Worker Configuration (5 fixes):**
1. Missing PYTHONPATH in worker container
2. Missing source volume mount for code access
3. Missing /tmp/apex-staging directory for local staging
4. Worker not finding temporal module
5. Worker not finding apex_memory.services module

**Staging Activity (3 fixes):**
6. Activity tried to copy file that was already staged

9. Entity Pydantic model missing \`uuid\` field
10. Neo4j relationship creation failing without UUID

**Workflow Execution (3 fixes):**
11. Step 5 (Neo4j) failing due to missing entity UUID
12. Step 6 (cache) failing due to entity serialization
13. Workflow stopping at step 5/6 instead of completing

### Results

**Workflow Execution:**
\`\`\`
✅ Step 1: Pull and stage document (COMPLETED)
✅ Step 2: Parse document chunks (COMPLETED - 9 chunks)
✅ Step 3: Extract entities (COMPLETED - 12 entities)
✅ Step 4: Generate embeddings (COMPLETED - 9 vectors)
✅ Step 5: Write to Neo4j (COMPLETED - 12 nodes, 8 relationships)
✅ Step 6: Update cache (COMPLETED)

## 📊 Session 2: Frontend Testing & Chat Integration

**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Critical Fixes (3 Total)

**1. ChatInterface Component Crash**
- **Problem:** \`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')\`
- **Fix:** Added default empty array for messages prop
- **Location:** \`ChatInterface.tsx:17\`

**2. Conversation Service Error Logging**
- **Problem:** Errors invisible in Docker logs (using \`print()\` instead of \`logger\`)
- **Fix:** Comprehensive logging with tracebacks and info-level API logs
- **Location:** \`conversation_service.py:8-9, 32, 382-420\`

**3. Context Aggregation Returning 0 Results**
- **Problem:** Graphiti found 10 results, aggregator showed 0 (missing UUID field)
- **Fix:** Modified \`format_results()\` to include uuid, title, content, score
- **Location:** \`graphiti_search.py:686-708\`

### Results

**Before vs. After Context Fix:**

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Graphiti results | 10 | 10 |
| Aggregation results | 0 ❌ | 10 ✅ |
| Citations | 0 | 5 ✅ |
| Response | Generic "no info" | Accurate with data ✅ |
